## One strategy: One master sales page + booking flow (sell capacity, not outcomes)

You’re selling readiness and priority. Build one killer sales page, a booking page, and a thank‑you. Paste-ready copy below. Use proof to create certainty and a clear “reason‑why” anti‑guarantee to set expectations [$100M Offers, Page 124] [$100M Playbook: Proof Checklist, Page 10].

## 1) Membership Sales Page (primary)

- Headline
  - Reserve Prescreen Capacity. Get Priority Matches for Your [Indication] Trials.
- Subhead
  - Members get consent‑ready handoffs with SLAs. Non‑members get raw leads.
- Primary CTA
  - Reserve Your Slot — Book a 15‑Minute Protocol Intake
- Trust strip
  - HIPAA‑secure • 24h first outreach • 48h handoff on matches • Daily portal updates

- What you get (bullets)
  - Qualified, prescreened candidates (I/E on paper, contactable, consent‑ready) within 48h when a match appears.
  - Each handoff includes contact info, I/E checklist score, and screener notes to speed site screen.
  - Reserved capacity + priority routing for Lung, Prostate, GI (US‑only).
  - Inputs SLAs: 24h first outreach, 48h handoff on matches, daily portal updates, weekly QA.

- How it works (4 steps)
  - 1) 45‑min protocol intake (I/E, geo, PI windows) 
  - 2) BAA + secure portal access
  - 3) Go‑live in 48 hours; daily drops; weekly QA
  - 4) Reporting: qualified delivered, site‑screen outcomes, time‑to‑enrollment

- Pricing (aligned to value)
  - Membership (retainer): reserves capacity, covers setup, prescreener build, and ongoing outreach/nurture systems.
  - Per‑Qualified Candidate Fee: only when the candidate meets I/E on paper and passes brief site verification. Invalids/duplicates credited.

- Terms — “Reason‑Why” Anti‑Guarantee
  - All sales final (monthly term). Reason why: rare indications are unpredictable and our costs are front‑loaded and consumable (outreach, data, staff). You’re reserving scarce capacity, not renting outcomes [$100M Offers, Page 124].

- Proof (visual > verbose)
  - De‑identified profiles, pipeline snapshots, time‑to‑handoff stats. Show, don’t tell [$100M Playbook: Proof Checklist, Page 10]. Favor raw/unpolished over overproduced for higher believability [$100M Playbook: Proof Checklist, Page 14].
  - Metaphor callout: “Runway slot” = capacity reservation. Simple metaphors beat jargon for fast understanding [$100M Playbook: Proof Checklist, Page 24].

- FAQ (tight)
  - Do you guarantee enrollments? No. Members buy readiness and priority. Non‑members receive raw leads only.
  - Can we pause? Yes, you can pause routing; capacity reservation continues per term.

- Secondary CTA
  - Book Your 15‑Minute Protocol Intake

## 2) Booking Page

- Headline
  - Lock Your Capacity Slot — 15‑Minute Protocol Intake
- Body
  - Bring I/E criteria, geo radius, and PI availability. We configure your prescreener, confirm SLAs, and go live in 48 hours.
- CTA
  - Pick a Time (calendar embed)
- Reassurance
  - HIPAA/BAA. Neutral outreach unless sponsor/site copy is provided.

## 3) Thank‑You Page

- Headline
  - You’re Scheduled. Here’s What Happens Next.
- Bullets
  - We finalize I/E + geo and activate your portal.
  - Go‑live within 48 hours of intake. Expect daily updates thereafter.
  - Optional: preview de‑identified sample profiles now.

## 4) Retarget/Squeeze (for fence‑sitters)

- Headline
  - See Exactly What a “Consent‑Ready” Handoff Looks Like
- Body
  - View 3 de‑identified profiles + a pipeline snapshot. No obligation.
- CTA
  - View Sample Profiles
- Note: Weave proof into reminders to lift show rates (match indication/demo to the site) [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 31].

## Implementation checklist

- Tracking: GA4/GTM events for CTA clicks, form submits, booked calls. 
- Legal: HIPAA/Privacy/Terms in footer. BAA referenced in setup.
- Congruence: Mirror ad headline on page; keep language dead‑simple. Use the “runway slot” metaphor in one line, not paragraphs [$100M Playbook: Proof Checklist, Page 24].

## Call to action

Publish this sales/booking/thank‑you flow today. Add de‑identified proof blocks and ship. Then drive Google Search traffic and book 10 protocol intakes before changing a word. Proof + clear anti‑guarantee = faster closes with fewer headaches [$100M Offers, Page 124] [$100M Playbook: Proof Checklist, Page 10].
