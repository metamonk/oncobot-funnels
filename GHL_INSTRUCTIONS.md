Perfect question — this is *exactly* where GoHighLevel shines when set up right. 👇
Let’s walk through **best practices for handling new opportunities** (from the moment they’re created) — including **automation**, **email/SMS sequencing**, and **lead nurturing optimization**.

---

## 🚀 STAGE 1: When an Opportunity Is Created

### 🔹 Trigger

**Trigger event:** “Opportunity Created” (or “Pipeline Stage = New Lead”)
→ This is your automation entry point.

### 🔹 Immediate Actions

Within seconds, your workflow should:

1. **Send a “speed-to-lead” message**

   * **Email** and/or **SMS** acknowledging their inquiry or submission.
   * Example:

     > “Hey {{first_name}}, thanks for reaching out! I just saw your info come through — I’ll get back to you shortly. In the meantime, here’s a quick overview of what we do…”

2. **Notify the sales team**

   * Internal notification: “New lead created — click to view in CRM.”
   * Optional: Auto-assign lead to a specific rep (round-robin or owner).

3. **Set opportunity stage = “New Lead / Awaiting Response”**

   * Ensures your pipeline reflects that the contact has been acknowledged.

## ✉️ STAGE 2: Nurture Sequence (Email + SMS)

If the lead doesn’t reply or convert within 1–2 days, trigger an **automated nurture sequence**.

### 💡 Recommended structure

| Day | Type        | Example Message                                                                            |
| --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0   | Email/SMS   | “Thanks for reaching out” intro message                                                    |
| 1   | Email       | Share your main value prop / short story / key offer                                       |
| 3   | Email + SMS | Case study, testimonial, or “common question” email                                        |
| 5   | Email       | FAQ or “what to expect next” message                                                       |
| 7   | Email       | Call-to-action (book a call, claim an offer, etc.)                                         |
| 10  | SMS         | “Hey {{first_name}}, just wanted to make sure you saw my last message — still interested?” |

> 💬 Keep SMS short and conversational. Emails should feel personalized but can be templated.

## ⚙️ STAGE 3: Behavior-Based Automation

### 🔸 Engagement Triggers

Set up GHL automations like:

* “If email opened 3+ times → Notify rep”
* “If link clicked → Move to ‘Engaged Lead’ stage”
* “If replied → Stop all other sequences + move to ‘Contacted’”

This ensures **no one gets spammed** and reps can prioritize warm leads.

---

## 📈 STAGE 4: Ongoing Lead Nurture (Cold → Warm Revival)

For older or cold opportunities:

* Create a **long-term nurture workflow** (weekly or monthly value-based content).
* Mix in **education + social proof** emails:
  “3 things our clients learned after switching to [your solution]”
  “Case study: How we helped [X company] achieve [Y result].”

You can tag those leads as “Cold” and **recycle** them into campaigns every few months.

---

## 🤖 STAGE 5: Augmentation (AI + Personalization)

You can supercharge this process with:

1. **AI-Powered Personalization**

   * Use GHL’s custom values + Smart Lists to insert dynamic content (e.g., service type, city, or pain point).
   * Optionally connect to **OpenAI** via webhook for AI-written follow-ups that sound personalized.

2. **Auto-qualification**

   * Use forms or chatbots to collect qualifying info (budget, timeline, needs).
   * Score leads automatically and move them to “Qualified” or “Disqualified.”

3. **AI assistant for replies**

   * Auto-draft responses when leads reply (GHL + ChatGPT integration via Zapier or Make).
   * Sales rep just approves and sends.

---

## 🔁 STAGE 6: Review & Optimize

* **KPIs to monitor:**

  * Reply rate
  * Booking rate
  * Stage conversion rate
  * Average time to first contact
  * Drop-off points in pipeline

* **Iterate** your workflows every 30–60 days.
  For example: test new subject lines, shorter messages, or split by lead source.

## 🧩 Example: “New Lead → Booked Call” Workflow Summary

**Trigger:** Opportunity created
**Actions:**

1. Send intro email + SMS
2. Wait 1 day → If no reply, send follow-up email
3. Wait 2 days → Send testimonial email
4. Wait 3 days → SMS check-in
5. If link clicked or reply received → Move to “Contacted”
6. If booking confirmed → Move to “Booked Call” and stop sequence
7. If no response after 10 days → Move to “Cold Lead” + long-term nurture
