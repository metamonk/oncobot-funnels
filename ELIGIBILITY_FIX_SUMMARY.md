# Eligibility Assessment Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
The query "what trials are available in chicago for me?" was not showing eligibility assessments in production results, even though the AI claimed to be showing them with "Relevance score: 85%".

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Pattern Recognition Failure
The `hasPersonalReference()` method in `query-classifier.ts` was not recognizing queries with "for me" when there were words between "trials" and "for me".

**Original Pattern**: `/trials?\s+for\s+me\b/i`
- Required "trials" immediately followed by "for me"
- Failed on: "trials available in chicago for me"

### Issue 2: "Near Me" Not Recognized as Personal
The phrase "near me" was not being recognized as a personal reference, causing queries like "NSCLC trials near me" to be treated as location queries instead of eligibility queries.

### Issue 3: ProfileInfluence Determination
Even when queries contained personal references, they were being classified as LOCATION_PRIMARY or CONDITION_PRIMARY, receiving lower ProfileInfluence levels (0.3-0.5) instead of PRIMARY (1.0).

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Enhanced Personal Reference Detection
**File**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials/query-classifier.ts`
**Method**: `hasPersonalReference()`

Added more flexible patterns:
```typescript
/\bfor\s+me\b/i,  // Simple "for me" anywhere in query
/\bnear\s+me\b/i,  // "near me" is inherently personal
/trials?\s+.*\s+for\s+me\b/i  // Flexible pattern for "trials...for me"
```

### Fix 2: Intent Override Logic
The existing logic (step 6.5 in `classify()` method) already overrides intent to ELIGIBILITY when personal references are detected. This fix now works correctly with the enhanced pattern detection.

## Results

### Before Fix
- "what trials are available in chicago for me?" → ProfileInfluence: 0.3 (BACKGROUND) → No eligibility assessments
- "NSCLC trials near me" → ProfileInfluence: 0.5 (CONTEXTUAL) → No eligibility assessments

### After Fix
- "what trials are available in chicago for me?" → ProfileInfluence: 1.0 (PRIMARY) → Full eligibility assessments
- "NSCLC trials near me" → ProfileInfluence: 1.0 (PRIMARY) → Full eligibility assessments
- "trials for me" → ProfileInfluence: 1.0 (PRIMARY) → Full eligibility assessments

## Testing Verification

All test cases now pass:
- ✅ Personal queries get ELIGIBILITY intent
- ✅ ELIGIBILITY intent gets ProfileInfluence.PRIMARY (1.0)
- ✅ PRIMARY influence triggers full eligibility assessment
- ✅ Eligibility data flows through to final results
- ✅ Escape hatches ("trials for anyone") still work

## Production Impact

These changes ensure that:
1. Users asking personal questions ("for me", "near me") get personalized eligibility assessments
2. The AI receives eligibility data to present to users
3. The system maintains backward compatibility with non-personal queries
4. Performance is not impacted (assessments only run when needed)

## Files Modified
1. `/lib/tools/clinical-trials/query-classifier.ts` - Enhanced `hasPersonalReference()` method

## Deployment Notes
- No database changes required
- No API changes required
- Backward compatible
- Can be deployed immediately
