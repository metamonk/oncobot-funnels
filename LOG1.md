Reasoning:  First, the user queried about "kras g12c trials in chicago," and I've just received the results from the clinical_trials tool. It returned a list of trials, with the most relevant ones highlighted based on the user's health profile.

Key details from the response:
- The tool found 1798 total matches, but it returned a subset.
- The trials are for NSCLC, which matches the user's profile (they have NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation).
- Several trials specifically mention KRAS G12C, like NCT05789082, which is directly relevant.
- Locations include places in the US, but not all are in Chicago. For example, NCT05789082 has locations in California, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, etc., but not explicitly Chicago. However, the user's location is Chicago, so I need to highlight proximity.

My role:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Summarize the results clearly.
- Highlight why trials match the user's profile (e.g., KRAS G12C mutation, NSCLC).
- Start with a summary: "I found X trials that might be relevant..."
- Present key details: NCT ID, title, phase, status, brief description.
- Acknowledge the user's profile: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."
- Remind that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.
- Offer next steps, like asking if they want more details on a specific trial.

Structure my response:
1. **Introduction/Summary**: Thank them for their patience, summarize the findings, and note how the profile was used.
2. **Highlight Relevant Trials**: Focus on the top matches, especially those with KRAS G12C. Prioritize trials with high relevance scores (e.g., 0.95).
3. **Present Trials**: List 3-5 key trials briefly, mentioning locations and why they match.
4. **Proximity to Chicago**: Since the user specified Chicago, note if any trials are nearby or suggest checking for travel.
5. **Next Steps**: Ask if they want more info, like details on a specific NCT ID, or help with contacting sites.
6. **Disclaimer**: End with the standard reminder.

Specific trials to highlight:
- NCT05789082: Directly mentions KRAS G12C, has US locations (e.g., California, New York), which might require travel from Chicago.
- Others like NCT06943820, but it's in China, so less relevant.
- Emphasize trials with US locations closer to Chicago if possible (e.g., New Haven, CT or Mineola, NY are somewhat closer than California).

Finally, end with: "This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions."

Keep it concise and not verbose.

The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials in chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials in chicago"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials in chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials in chicago"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before I help you search for clinical trials related to KRAS G12C in Chicago, I need to quickly check if you have a health profile.
