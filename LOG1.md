Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked to confirm if specific trials (listed by NCT IDs) are in Chicago. I used the clinical_trials tool to query this, providing the list and the user's location (41.8781, -87.6298, which is Chicago).

The response from the tool includes details for each trial, including locations. I need to extract and summarize whether these trials have sites in Chicago.

From the response:

- NCT04613596: Locations include Arizona, Arkansas, California, etc. No mention of Chicago.

- NCT06119581: Locations include Huntsville, AL; Gilbert, AZ; etc. No Chicago.

- NCT06890598: Locations include Birmingham, AL; Tucson, AZ; etc. No Chicago.

- NCT06252649: Locations include Chandler, AZ; Fullerton, CA; etc. No Chicago, but wait‚Äî in the full list, it says "Insight Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois" for this one. Let me check: Yes, in the locations for NCT06252649, it includes "Insight Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois, United States, status: RECRUITING".

- NCT03785249: Locations include Birmingham, AL; Anchorage, AK; etc. No Chicago.

- NCT05585320: Locations include Scottsdale, AZ; Duarte, CA; etc. It mentions "Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois" ‚Äì Yes, for NCT05585320, it has "Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, United States, status: RECRUITING".

- NCT03785249: Wait, no, for NCT03785249, it's listed as having sites in various places, but in the summary, it says "Birmingham, Alabama + 4 more locations", and in the full list, it might not specify Chicago. Wait, in the detailed locations, it has "Boca Raton, FL; Beverly Hills, CA; etc." No Chicago for this one.

Let me double-check:

From the response:

- NCT05585320: Yes, "Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois"

- NCT06252649: "Insight Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois"

- Others: No explicit mention of Chicago.

So, specifically:

- NCT06497556: No Chicago

- NCT05609578: No Chicago

- NCT04613596: No

- NCT06119581: No

- NCT06890598: No

- NCT05920356: No

- NCT05585320: Yes, Chicago

- NCT03785249: No

- NCT04185883: No

- NCT05638295: No

- NCT06252649: Yes, Chicago

Trials with sites in Chicago: NCT05585320 and NCT06252649.

I need to respond compassionately, informatively, and guide the user. Remember to not give medical advice, just information.

Structure the response:

1. Acknowledge the query and summarize the findings.

2. List the trials that have sites in Chicago.

3. For those that do, mention the facility if available.

4. Remind the user that this is for informational purposes and they should consult their healthcare provider.

5. Offer next steps, like asking if they want more details or help with contacting sites.

Finally, end with the standard disclaimer.

      '\n' +
      '  - The user is asking to confirm if these trials are in Chicago, which involves looking up specific NCT IDs and checking their locations.\n' +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      `The tool description: "Search and analyze clinical trials. Simply pass the user's natural language query." Examples include "What are the locations for NCT05568550?" and "Show trials near Boston".\n` +

      "Additionally, the user's location is given as 41.8781, -87.6298, which is Chicago, so I can use that for proximity if needed, but the tool parameters include userLatitude and userLongitude, which are optional.\n" +

      '\n' +
      `- It's required: {"query": "string"}\n` +

      '\n' +
      'The prompt says: "The tool automatically: - Uses health profiles when available - Handles location-based searches"\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So, I can just pass the query, and it will handle it.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Now, for the function call:\n' +
