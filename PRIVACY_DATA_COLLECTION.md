## Our Commitment to Privacy

OncoBot is committed to protecting your privacy while providing valuable clinical trial search services. We collect only the data necessary to improve our service and help users find relevant clinical trials more effectively.

## What We Collect

### 1. Usage Analytics

We use privacy-focused analytics to understand how our service is used:

- **Page views and navigation patterns** - Which pages you visit and in what order
- **Search queries** - What you search for (not linked to your identity)
- **Interaction events** - Buttons clicked, features used, time spent on pages
- **Device information** - Browser type, operating system, screen size
- **General location** - Country and state/region (never precise location)

**We DO NOT collect:**
- Your name or email address (unless you explicitly provide it)
- IP addresses
- Precise location data
- Cross-site tracking information
- Any personally identifiable information

### 2. Clinical Trial Interaction Data

To improve our matching and recommendation system, we track:

- Which clinical trials you view
- Trial IDs you copy for reference
- When you click to view trials on ClinicalTrials.gov
- If you initiate contact with a trial site (we track the action, not your personal details)
- Search filters and criteria you use
- Whether searches return useful results

### 3. Optional Health Profile

If you choose to complete a health profile to get personalized trial matches:

- **What we store**: General cancer type, stage, and treatment preferences
