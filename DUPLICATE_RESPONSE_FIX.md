# Duplicate Response Fix Summary

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Forced Health Profile Check**
**Problem**: System prompt contained a CRITICAL instruction forcing AI to always check health profile before searching for trials, causing unnecessary delays and extra tool calls.

**Location**: `/app/actions.ts:1027`

**Original**:
```
**CRITICAL**: When a user asks about clinical trials, ALWAYS check their health profile status first using the health_profile tool with action: 'check'
```

### 2. **Duplicate Messages in Request**
**Problem**: The query "kras g12c chicago" appeared twice in the messages array sent to the AI model, causing duplicate processing.

**Evidence**: 
```json
{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c chicago"},
{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c chicago"}
```

### 3. **Connection Errors**
**Problem**: `ECONNRESET` errors and "Failed to create resumable stream" errors potentially causing retries.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated System Prompt** (`/app/actions.ts`)
- Changed from forcing health profile checks to intelligent optional use
- Made it clear that clinical_trials tool automatically uses profile when available
- Added explicit instruction: "When user says 'just show me trials' - go straight to clinical_trials tool"

**Key Changes**:
- Line 1027: Changed "ALWAYS check" to "INTELLIGENT PROFILE USE"
- Line 1028: Added "DO NOT check health profile separately"
- Line 1046: Added "NEVER call health_profile tool unless user specifically asks"
- Line 1057-1058: Clarified health_profile tool should ONLY be used when explicitly requested

### 2. **Added Message Deduplication** (`/app/api/search/route.ts`)
- Added defensive deduplication logic at line 117-127
- Removes consecutive identical messages before processing
- Logs when duplicates are detected and removed

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const messages = rawMessages.reduce((acc: any[], msg: any, index: number) => {
  // Skip if this message is identical to the previous one
  if (index > 0 && 
      acc[acc.length - 1].role === msg.role && 
      acc[acc.length - 1].content === msg.content) {
    console.log('⚠️ Duplicate message detected and removed:', msg.content?.substring(0, 50));
    return acc;
  }
  acc.push(msg);
  return acc;
}, []);
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Maintained

### TRUE AI-DRIVEN Principles Preserved
- ✅ No hardcoded patterns added
- ✅ Pure AI orchestration maintained
- ✅ Atomic tool architecture intact
- ✅ Fixes through configuration, not rigid rules

### What This Achieves
1. **Faster responses** - No unnecessary health profile checks
2. **Single response** - Deduplication prevents multiple responses
3. **Direct search** - Users can say "just show me trials" and get immediate results
4. **Clean logs** - Duplicate messages are detected and logged

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before:
1. User: "kras g12c chicago"
2. AI: Checks health profile first
3. AI: Then searches for trials
4. Duplicate message causes second search
5. Result: Two responses with different trial counts

### After:
1. User: "kras g12c chicago"
2. AI: Goes directly to clinical_trials tool
3. Duplicates removed if present
4. Result: Single response with trial results

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Test direct search**: Try "kras g12c chicago" and verify single response
2. **Test "just show me" pattern**: Try "just show me the trials" and verify no health profile check
3. **Monitor logs**: Check for "Duplicate message detected and removed" messages
4. **Verify UI cards**: Ensure trial cards display properly (previous fix still working)

## 📝 Notes

- The duplicate message issue appears to be client-side, but we've added server-side protection
- Connection errors may still occur but won't cause duplicate responses
- Health profile is still used automatically by clinical_trials tool when available
- Users can still explicitly ask about their health profile when needed
