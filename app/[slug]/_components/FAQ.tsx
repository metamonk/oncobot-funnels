              <ProAccordionContent>
                No. Checking eligibility is free. All trial-related medical care, study medications, 
                and procedures are provided at no cost to participants. Many trials also provide 
                compensation for time and travel expenses.

              <ProAccordionContent>
                No. We help explore trial options and connect you with trial coordinators. 
                All medical decisions should be made with your doctor. We provide information 
                about available trials, but we don&apos;t diagnose conditions or recommend 
                specific treatments.

              <ProAccordionTrigger>What if I don&apos;t qualify for any trials?</ProAccordionTrigger>
              <ProAccordionContent>
                Trials open and close frequently. If you don&apos;t match with a trial today, 
                we&apos;ll add you to our waitlist and notify you immediately when new trials 
                matching your profile become available. We continuously monitor for new opportunities 
                and many patients who don&apos;t initially qualify find matches within a few weeks.

                You can withdraw at any time for any reason without affecting your regular 
                medical care. The trial team will explain the withdrawal process during 
                your initial consultation.
