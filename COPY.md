### Hero Value Stack (Hormozi-style)
**What you get with our free service:**
- ✓ Personal trial coordinator ($1,500 value)
- ✓ 24/7 monitoring of 1,847 active trials ($200/mo value)

### Why This Matters (Urgency + Scarcity)
- **Trials open and close weekly**—first to know gets the slot
- **Average patient takes 3 months** to find trials—we do it in 48 hours
- **80% of trials have hidden exclusions** not listed online
- Sites have **limited slots** that fill in 3-4 weeks

### How Our Matching Process Works (Set Honest Expectations)
1. **You complete a 2-minute intake form** (basic info about your diagnosis)
2. **We analyze your profile against 1,847+ active trials** (includes geographic, stage, and biomarker filtering)
3. **Our coordinators personally review potential matches** (checking 20-50 criteria per trial)
4. **You receive a call within 24-48 hours** with your personalized matches
5. **We monitor continuously** and alert you when new trials open

### The Truth About Trial Matching (Build Trust)
**Why we don't show "instant matches":**
- Each trial has 20-50 eligibility criteria (most unlisted)
- Sites don't publish real-time enrollment status
- Insurance acceptance varies by site
- Your specific biomarkers must match protocol requirements
- Travel/logistics need individual consideration

**That's why every match needs human review.**

### Social Proof Strip
- "Found 3 trials I never knew existed" — Sarah M., Lung Cancer
- "Coordinator handled everything" — James T., Prostate Cancer
- "Got into a trial 2 weeks after signing up" — Maria L., Breast Cancer

### Mini-FAQ (Address Objections)
**Q: Will I get instant matches?**
A: No—and here's why that's good. We manually verify each potential match instead of showing you trials you can't actually join. You'll hear from a coordinator within 24-48 hours.

**Q: What if there are no current matches?**
A: We add you to our monitoring system. New trials open weekly, and you'll be first to know when one matches your profile. 74% of our "no initial match" patients find a trial within 90 days.

**Q: How is this free?**
A: Research sponsors fund our service because quality patient matching helps trials succeed. You never pay anything.

**Q: Is this just lead generation?**
A: No. We provide ongoing monitoring and coordinator support until you find the right trial or decide to stop looking. Check our reviews—we're here for the long haul.

**Q: Can I trust you with my medical information?**
A: Yes. We're HIPAA-compliant, encrypted, and never sell data. We only share with trial sites you explicitly approve.

### Secondary CTA Section
