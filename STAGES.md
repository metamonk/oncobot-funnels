## Answer: Bake “Triage” into Pre‑Screening, don’t add a new stage

You don’t need more stages. You need tighter definitions and SLAs. Make “triage” a required task inside Pre‑Screening (5‑minute verification call + desk check), not its own stage. Too many stages = slow ops; tight stages + BAMFAM = speed and show rates [$100M Leads, Page 183] [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 34] [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 46].

## Clean pipeline (with hard entry/exit criteria)

- New Lead
  - Entry: Quiz Complete.
  - Auto‑actions: create “Call Now” task; start follow‑up cadence (double‑dial + text 3x Day 0; 2x/day Days 1–2; 1x/day next 4 days) [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 34].
  - Exit: live connect OR scheduled triage.

- Pre‑Screening (includes triage)
  - Required tasks: 5‑min triage call to verify I/E on paper, contactability, intent, ZIP; desk review notes.
  - SLA: first contact same day; keep cadence until disposition [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 46].
  - Exit: Qualified or Not Qualified.

- Qualified (provisional)
  - Entry: passes I/E on paper; consent to proceed; contactable.
  - Exit: Site Matched.

- Site Matched
  - Entry: site selected (member vs non‑member).
  - Exit: Handoff sent.

- Contacted (rename to Handoff Sent)
  - Entry: package sent to site (I/E checklist + screener notes).
  - Exit: Scheduled.

- Scheduled
  - Define it: site‑screen appointment set (not your triage).
  - Exit: Enrolled or Not Qualified (site DNQ).

- Enrolled
  - Entry: randomized/consented per site confirmation.

- Not Qualified
  - Entry: DNQ at triage, desk review, or site screen.
  - Side paths: Waitlist (no match now), Unresponsive (stalled >14 days).

## Why this works

- Triage = a task, not a stage. Keeps the pipeline lean and forces action (speed + volume) that increases show rates [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 46].
- BAMFAM: book the next step from the current step—no “no‑man’s‑land.” At triage, schedule the site screen or the next touch before you hang up [$100M Leads, Page 183].
- Clear handoffs: “Scheduled” means site appointment only; your internal 5‑min call lives in Pre‑Screening.

## Automation + fields (keep it measurable)

- Auto‑create “Call Now” on New Lead; start cadence (see above) [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 34].
- Timestamps: time‑to‑first‑contact, triage completed, handoff sent, scheduled date.
- Tags: member vs non‑member site; indication; geo.
- Lead score (simple): red/yellow/green and route your best to your best closer [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 28].

## Guardrails

- No medical advice. Use “provisional match; final eligibility by study site.”
- Show proof across follow‑up to lift show rates (de‑identified examples, timelines) [$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture, Page 46].

## Call to action

Rename “Contacted” to “Handoff Sent,” define “Scheduled” as site appointment, and make “Triage” a required task within Pre‑Screening with the Page‑34 cadence. Implement BAMFAM at every live touch. Track time‑to‑contact, show rate, and time‑to‑handoff weekly—and fix the lowest metric first.
