Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?" I responded by immediately using the clinical_trials tool with searchParams: { useProfile: true, maxResults: 10 }. Now, I've received the results from that tool call.

The results show a list of clinical trials that match based on the user's health profile. From the function response, it's for trials related to NSCLC, as it mentions "NSCLC diagnosis" in the matching criteria for several trials.

Key points from the results:
- There are 2328 total matches, but we're only showing 10.
- Trials are for conditions like Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma, various stages, etc.
- The first trial (NCT06732401) is for NSCLC and seems highly relevant.

I need to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way. Structure my response as per the guidelines:
- Start with a summary: "I found X trials that might be relevant..."
- Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description.
- ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile (e.g., based on cancer type, stage, molecular markers).
- Acknowledge what specific information from their profile I'm using.
- End with the disclaimer.

From the health profile integration: I should acknowledge what's in their profile. The tool used useProfile: true, so it's based on their NSCLC diagnosis, possibly with KRAS G12C mutation if that's in their profile.

In the conversation context, this is the first response, so I need to refer back naturally. The user's profile likely includes details like cancer type (NSCLC), stage, etc.

Presenting results:
- Summarize: There are 10 trials listed, but 2328 total matches, which is a lot, so I should note it's broad and suggest refinements.
- Group by relevance: Exact matches first.
- For each trial, highlight: Why it matches (e.g., "This trial is for NSCLC, which matches your diagnosis...").
- Offer next steps: Ask if they want more details on a specific trial or help refine the search.

Finally, include the disclaimer: "This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions."

Structure the response:
1. Empathize and summarize findings.
2. List or summarize the top trials, focusing on relevance.
3. Suggest next actions.
4. Disclaimer.

    text: "I appreciate you reaching out about clinical trials for your specific type and stage of cancer—it's a proactive step, and I'm here to support you through this process. Based on your health profile, which includes details like your NSCLC diagnosis (and any associated factors such as stage or molecular markers like KRAS G12C if noted), I conducted a search for relevant trials. This helps ensure the results are tailored to your situation, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and potential matches for your profile.\n" +

      "From the search, I found a total of 2,328 trials that could be relevant, but I've narrowed it down to the top 10 results for simplicity. Many of these trials target NSCLC, including those for advanced stages and specific mutations, which aligns with your profile. For instance, several trials match your NSCLC diagnosis and may consider factors like stage II-III or molecular markers, making them potentially good fits. Since the total number is quite high, this suggests we might refine the search later for even more personalized options.\n" +

      '\n' +
      '10. **NCT05764928**  \n' +
      "    - **Why it matches:** For advanced EGFR wild-type NSCLC, which aligns with your profile if EGFR isn't a factor, and it's for first-line treatment options.  \n" +

    reasoning: `First, the user asked: "Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?" I responded by immediately using the clinical_trials tool with searchParams: { useProfile: true, maxResults: 10 }. Now, I've received the results from that tool call.\n` +

      '\n' +
      "From the health profile integration: I should acknowledge what's in their profile. The tool used useProfile: true, so it's based on their NSCLC diagnosis, possibly with KRAS G12C mutation if that's in their profile.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "In the conversation context, this is the first response, so I need to refer back naturally. The user's profile likely includes details like cancer type (NSCLC), stage, etc.\n" +

      '- For each trial, highlight: Why it matches (e.g., "This trial is for NSCLC, which matches your diagnosis...").\n' +

Based on your health profile, which includes details like your NSCLC diagnosis (and any associated factors such as stage or molecular markers like KRAS G12C if noted), I conducted a search for relevant trials. This helps ensure the results are tailored to your situation, focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and potential matches for your profile.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "From the search, I found a total of 2,328 trials that could be relevant, but I've narrowed it down to the top 10 results for simplicity. Many of these trials target NSCLC, including those for advanced stages and specific mutations, which aligns with your profile. For instance, several trials match your NSCLC diagnosis and may consider factors like stage II-III or molecular markers, making them potentially good fits. Since the total number is quite high, this suggests we might refine the search later for even more personalized options.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Here's a summary of the top trials. I'll highlight the most relevant ones first, based on how they align with your profile (e.g., NSCLC type, stage, and any mutation details). Remember, these are for educational purposes only—final eligibility is determined by the trial teams, and I encourage you to discuss this with your healthcare provider.\n" +
