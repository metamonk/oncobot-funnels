# Naming Improvements - Saved Trials System

## Context-Aware Refactoring

Following CLAUDE.md principles, the saved trials system has been refactored with cleaner, more descriptive names that reflect what components actually do rather than their implementation history.

## Changes Made

### Components
- ✅ `SaveButtonUnified` → `TrialSaveButton`
  - Clear, descriptive name that explains its purpose
  - No "Unified" suffix exposing implementation details
  - Located in `/components/clinical-trials/trial-save-button.tsx`

### Hooks  
- ✅ `useLocalFirstSaves` → `useSavedTrials`
  - Simple, clear hook name
  - Describes what it manages, not how
  - Located in `/hooks/use-saved-trials.ts`

### Files Removed (Unused/Old)
- ❌ `/hooks/use-event-based-save.tsx` - Old implementation
- ❌ `/hooks/use-local-first-saves.ts` - Renamed
- ❌ `/components/clinical-trials/save-button-unified.tsx` - Renamed
- ❌ `/components/clinical-trials-local-first.tsx` - Unused
- ❌ `/hooks/use-save-queue.ts` - Unused
- ❌ `/scripts/test-save-queue.ts` - Outdated test

## Naming Principles Applied

1. **Descriptive over Historical**: Names describe what components do, not their implementation evolution
2. **Simple and Clear**: Removed unnecessary suffixes like "Unified", "Local-First", etc.
3. **Consistent Pattern**: All saved trial related code uses clear, consistent naming
4. **No Implementation Leakage**: Names don't expose internal architecture decisions

## Current Architecture

```
Saved Trials System
├── Components
│   ├── TrialSaveButton - Save button with no re-renders
│   └── SavedTrialsSection - Settings modal section
├── Hooks
│   └── useSavedTrials - Main hook for saved trials management
├── Services
│   ├── saved-trials-service - Database operations
│   ├── saved-trials-actions - Server actions
│   └── local-storage-manager - localStorage sync
└── Types
    └── types.ts - TypeScript interfaces
```

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 6 unused/duplicate files
- **Better Discoverability**: Clear names make components easier to find
- **Maintainability**: New developers understand purpose immediately
- **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved with better names
