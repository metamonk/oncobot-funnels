Reasoning:  First, the user queried about "kras g12c trials in chicago," which is a specific search for clinical trials. I correctly used the clinical_trials tool for this.

The function call response provides a list of trials. I need to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way.

Key points from the response:
- There are 10 matches.
- Trials are for KRAS G12C mutations, relevant to NSCLC based on the user's profile.
- Some trials have locations in or near Chicago, like NCT04302025 and NCT04712877 at Northwestern University in Chicago.
- I must highlight matches to the user's profile, especially KRAS G12C.
- Always remind that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.

Structure my response:
1. **Summary**: Start with a positive, encouraging summary of what I found.
2. **Personalization**: Acknowledge the user's health profile, e.g., "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."
3. **Present Trials**: List key details clearly: NCT ID, title, phase, status, and relevant locations. Highlight those in Chicago.
4. **Relevance**: Explain why they match, e.g., targets KRAS G12C.
5. **Next Steps**: Offer to provide more details or help with follow-ups.
6. **Disclaimer**: End with the standard reminder.

Since the response includes trials with distances, I can note proximity.

From the data:
- Trials like NCT04302025 and NCT04712877 have locations in Chicago, with distance 0, meaning they're right there.
- Others are farther but might still be relevant.

Keep it concise and not verbose.

Finally, end the response without another function call unless needed. The user's request seems fulfilled, so no immediate need.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    • \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    • \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    • \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    • \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    • NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    • NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    • New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    • Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    • More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    • Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    • Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    • Extracts locations from natural language\\n    • Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    • Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials in chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials in chicago"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

      '   - **Status**: Recruiting  \n' +
      "   - **Locations**: Sites in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Texas, Kansas, and Tennessee—no direct Chicago site, but it's within a reasonable distance for consideration.  \n" +
      '   - **Distance**: About 237 miles (closest sites are in nearby states).  \n' +
      '\n' +
      '5. **Other Notable Trials**:  \n' +
      '   - Trials like NCT06119581, NCT06497556, and NCT05609578 also target KRAS G12C in NSCLC and are recruiting, but their sites are more spread out (e.g., in California, Alabama, and Florida). They might require travel, with distances around 237 miles from Chicago. I prioritized the ones closest to you.\n' +

    content: "I see you're interested in clinical trials for KRAS G12C mutations, specifically those near Chicago. That's a great step in exploring your options—KRAS G12C is a common target in certain cancers, like lung cancer, and there are trials designed for it.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'Before I dive into searching for trials, I want to make sure I can provide the most personalized results based on your health details. Let me quickly check if you have a health profile set up.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Great news—your health profile is all set and complete, which means I can use it to personalize the trial search for you. Based on what you've shared, I'll search for clinical trials targeting KRAS G12C mutations, focusing on locations near Chicago (using your approximate location of 41.8781 latitude and -87.6298 longitude). This will help match trials to your profile details, like your cancer type if it's in your profile.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'Let me pull up the most relevant options for you.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "I appreciate you reaching out about KRAS G12C trials, especially with a focus on Chicago—it's smart to look into options that align with your situation. Based on your health profile, which indicates a diagnosis of NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation, I've pulled up some relevant trials. This helps me prioritize matches that could be a good fit for your profile.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "From the search, I found 10 trials that target KRAS G12C mutations and are potentially accessible near your location (around Chicago). Many of these are for advanced NSCLC, which matches your profile's details. Here's a summary of the top ones, with a focus on those in or closest to Chicago:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '### Key Trial Highlights:\n' +
      '1. **NCT04302025: A Study of Multiple Therapies in Biomarker-Selected Patients With Resectable Stages IB-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches**: This trial specifically includes patients with NSCLC and biomarker testing like KRAS G12C, aligning with your profile. It's in Phase 2 and currently recruiting.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase**: 2  \n' +
      '   - **Status**: Recruiting  \n' +
      '   - **Locations**: Includes a site at Northwestern University in Chicago—right in your area! Other sites are in California and Texas.  \n' +
      '   - **Distance**: Approximately 0 miles from your location.  \n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. **NCT04712877: Testing Tumor Tissue and Blood to Help Select Personalized Treatments for Patients With Suspected Lung Cancers**  \n' +
      '   - **Why it matches**: Focuses on NSCLC with genetic markers like KRAS G12C, which is prominent in your profile. This is an observational study, not interventional, so it could be a good starting point for more personalized options.  \n' +
      '   - **Phase**: Not applicable (observational)  \n' +
      '   - **Status**: Recruiting  \n' +
      '   - **Locations**: Includes Northwestern University in Chicago, along with sites in California, Florida, Massachusetts, and Missouri.  \n' +
      '   - **Distance**: Approximately 0 miles from your location.  \n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. **NCT05853575: Trial of Two Adagrasib Dosing Regimens in NSCLC With KRAS G12C Mutation (KRYSTAL 21)**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches**: Directly targets KRAS G12C in advanced NSCLC, matching your mutation and cancer type. It's evaluating treatments like adagrasib, which is common for this biomarker.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase**: 2  \n' +
      '   - **Status**: Recruiting  \n' +
      '   - **Locations**: One site at a local institution in Chicago, plus others in California, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas.  \n' +
      '   - **Distance**: Approximately 0 miles from your location.  \n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. **NCT04613596: Phase 2 Trial of Adagrasib Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab**  \n' +
      '   - **Why it matches**: This trial is for advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C and includes combination therapies, which could be relevant based on your profile.  \n' +
      '   - **Phase**: 2/3  \n' +
      '   - **Status**: Recruiting  \n' +
      "   - **Locations**: Sites in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Texas, Kansas, and Tennessee—no direct Chicago site, but it's within a reasonable distance for consideration.  \n" +
      '   - **Distance**: About 237 miles (closest sites are in nearby states).  \n' +
      '\n' +
      '5. **Other Notable Trials**:  \n' +
      '   - Trials like NCT06119581, NCT06497556, and NCT05609578 also target KRAS G12C in NSCLC and are recruiting, but their sites are more spread out (e.g., in California, Alabama, and Florida). They might require travel, with distances around 237 miles from Chicago. I prioritized the ones closest to you.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "These trials are actively recruiting and focus on innovative treatments for KRAS G12C mutations, which is a key detail in your health profile. Remember, eligibility is determined by the trial teams, so it's important to discuss this with your healthcare provider.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "If you'd like more details on any specific trial (like NCT IDs, contact info, or eligibility criteria), or if you want me to refine this search—say, for trials further away or with other filters—just let me know. This information is for educational purposes only. Please consult your doctor before pursuing any next steps. How can I assist you further?"
