Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "Are there any lung cancer studies recruiting patients near me?" I've already checked their health profile, which is complete, and then I called the clinical_trials tool.

The function response shows that we have results: 1 trial matched, NCT06681220. However, it's important to note the recruitment status: "NOT_YET_RECRUITING", which means it's not currently open for enrollment. The response also includes details like locations, including one in Chicago, IL.

Key points from the response:
- Trial: NCT06681220 for Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer.
- Locations: Includes Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, IL.
- Status: Not Yet Recruiting.
- Relevance: Based on the user's profile, there's a match score of 70, but it's for Small Cell Lung Cancer, which might or might not align perfectly with the user's profile (e.g., if they have NSCLC).
- Eligibility: The assessment shows a score of 0.55, recommendation "possible", with some missing data.

In my response, I need to:
- Be warm and supportive.
- Summarize the results clearly.
- Highlight why it matches based on their profile.
- Remind them that this is not medical advice and they should consult their doctor.
- Since the trial isn't recruiting yet, I should note that and suggest checking back or looking for others.
- If there are no actively recruiting trials, I could suggest refining the search or providing more info.

The response says "Found 1 trials in Chicago, IL", but it's not recruiting. I should present this accurately.

Structure my response:
1. Start with a summary: "I found one trial that might be relevant based on your profile..."
2. Present key details: NCT ID, title, phase, status, locations.
3. Explain relevance: Reference their profile (e.g., if it matches their cancer type).
4. Acknowledge limitations: Not recruiting, potential eligibility.
5. Offer next steps: Ask if they want more details, to search for others, or to update their profile.
6. End with the standard disclaimer.

Finally, decide if I need to call another function. This seems to fulfill the query, so no immediate need unless they follow up.

Response format: Keep it clear and not verbose.

The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any lung cancer studies recruiting patients near me?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any lung cancer studies recruiting patients near me?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

It's always a good idea to discuss this with your healthcare team for the latest updates.\n" +

      '- **Trial Details:**\n' +
      '  - **NCT ID:** NCT06681220\n' +
      '  - **Title:** Biomarker Directed Trial of Temozolomide and Stenoparib in Relapsed SCLC\n' +
      '  - **Phase:** Phase 1/2\n' +
      "  - **Conditions:** This trial focuses on relapsed or recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). Based on your health profile, it aligns somewhat with lung cancer types, but I want to highlight that it's specifically for SCLC. If your profile indicates SCLC or related markers, this could be relevant.\n" +
      '  - **Status:** Not Yet Recruiting (expected to start soon, but confirm with the trial team).\n' +
      '  - **Locations:** One site is right in your area‚Äîat the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, IL. Other locations include places like Palo Alto, CA, and Indianapolis, IN, but the Chicago site makes it conveniently close.\n' +
      '  - **Why it Matches:** Your profile helped me prioritize this based on lung cancer specifics, such as stage or potential biomarkers. For instance, if your profile notes details like stage IV, it factors into the relevance score (which was 70 out of 100 here).\n' +
      '\n' +
      "This is just one option, and since it's not actively recruiting, there might not be immediate opportunities. Clinical trials can change status quickly, so it's worth checking back or exploring broader searches.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "If you'd like, I can help with next steps:\n" +
      '- Search for more trials (e.g., ones that are actively recruiting or for other lung cancer types).\n' +
      '- Provide more details on this specific trial, like eligibility criteria.\n' +
      '- Refine the search based on additional preferences, such as trial phase or other locations.\n' +

      '- Status: Not Yet Recruiting.\n' +

      '- Eligibility: The assessment shows a score of 0.55, recommendation "possible", with some missing data.\n' +

    content: 'Before I help you search for lung cancer studies, I need to quickly check if you have a health profile. This will allow me to provide more personalized results based on any details you might have shared, like your cancer type or stage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Great news ‚Äì I see that you already have a complete health profile, which means I can use that information to make our search more personalized. Based on what's in your profile, I'll look for lung cancer studies that might match your situation, such as your cancer type, stage, or any molecular markers like KRAS G12C if applicable.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Now, let's search for trials recruiting patients near your location in the Chicago area. I'll factor in your details to find the most relevant ones.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "I appreciate you sharing your query, and I'm glad we could use your health profile to tailor the search. Based on the details in your profile‚Äîlike your lung cancer diagnosis and other factors‚ÄîI've looked for studies recruiting near your location in Chicago. Here's what I found:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '### Summary of Results:\n' +
      "I identified **1 potential clinical trial** that matches your query for lung cancer studies. However, please note that this trial is **not yet recruiting**, meaning it's not currently open for enrollment. It's always a good idea to discuss this with your healthcare team for the latest updates.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '- **Trial Details:**\n' +
      '  - **NCT ID:** NCT06681220\n' +
      '  - **Title:** Biomarker Directed Trial of Temozolomide and Stenoparib in Relapsed SCLC\n' +
      '  - **Phase:** Phase 1/2\n' +
      "  - **Conditions:** This trial focuses on relapsed or recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). Based on your health profile, it aligns somewhat with lung cancer types, but I want to highlight that it's specifically for SCLC. If your profile indicates SCLC or related markers, this could be relevant.\n" +
      '  - **Status:** Not Yet Recruiting (expected to start soon, but confirm with the trial team).\n' +
      '  - **Locations:** One site is right in your area‚Äîat the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, IL. Other locations include places like Palo Alto, CA, and Indianapolis, IN, but the Chicago site makes it conveniently close.\n' +
      '  - **Why it Matches:** Your profile helped me prioritize this based on lung cancer specifics, such as stage or potential biomarkers. For instance, if your profile notes details like stage IV, it factors into the relevance score (which was 70 out of 100 here).\n' +
      '\n' +
      "This is just one option, and since it's not actively recruiting, there might not be immediate opportunities. Clinical trials can change status quickly, so it's worth checking back or exploring broader searches.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "If you'd like, I can help with next steps:\n" +
      '- Search for more trials (e.g., ones that are actively recruiting or for other lung cancer types).\n' +
      '- Provide more details on this specific trial, like eligibility criteria.\n' +
      '- Refine the search based on additional preferences, such as trial phase or other locations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Remember, this information is for educational purposes only and doesn't guarantee eligibility‚Äîtrial teams make the final call. Please consult your healthcare provider before pursuing any trials.\n" +
      '\n' +
