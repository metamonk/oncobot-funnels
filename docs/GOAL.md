## One strategy: Search-intent first (Google Ads only)

Start where patients already have intent: Google Search. One offer, one avatar, one platform. Capture “clinical trial + condition + near me” demand, then scale. Simple scales; fancy fails [$100M Leads, Page 247] [$100M Leads, Page 127].

### Setup (fast, tight, local)
- One campaign per indication (Lung, Prostate, GI), radius around each site.
- Exact/Phrase match only. Tight negatives. Call + lead form extensions.
- Conversions: Quiz start, Quiz complete, Booked call.
- Ad schedule: business hours + 1 hour buffer.

### Targeting & keywords (examples)
- Core: “clinical trial [condition] near me”, “research study [condition]”, “[condition] trial eligibility”, “phase 2/3 [condition] trial”.
- Long-tail: “[biomarker] clinical trial”, “[therapy] refractory trial”, “immunotherapy trial [condition]”.
- Negatives: definition, jobs, salary, guideline, NIH, Wikipedia, PDF, nursing, fellowship, animal, preclinical, journal, CME, free.
- Geo: 15–30 mile radius per site; expand as volume supports.

### Ads that win = Callout + Value + CTA
- Callout: “Qualify for a [Condition] clinical trial near you?”
- Value: “2‑minute eligibility check. HIPAA-secure. Zero cost.”
- CTA: “Check eligibility now” → Quiz [$100M Leads, Page 130].
- Spend 80% of prep on hooks. Write 50 variations up front (e.g., newly diagnosed, post‑chemo, biomarker‑positive, caregiver angles) [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 9].

### Landing + quiz flow
- Above the fold: “Do you qualify for a [Condition] clinical trial near [ZIP]? 2‑minute check.”
- Step 1: ZIP + condition. Step 2: stage/biomarkers/prior therapy. Step 3: contact consent.
- Output: “Provisional match” + scheduler or callback request. Everyone enters follow‑up.

### Budget & metrics
- Start $10–$20/day per indication; throttle to winners.
- Benchmarks to watch: 
  - CTR ≥ 5%, LP→Quiz Start ≥ 25%, Completion ≥ 60%, Opt‑in ≥ 40%.
  - Cost per Quiz Complete is your north star—optimize bids/keywords/ad copy to drop it. Efficiency > creativity [$100M Leads, Page 143].

### Why search only (now)
- Highest signal: They’re actively seeking trials vs interrupting them on social.
- Fit for rare conditions: Intent beats broad fishing with tiny budgets. Start small puddle → expand when ROI is proven [$100M Leads, Page 127].

### Compliance guardrails
- Neutral claims only: “Eligibility check,” not outcomes.
- HIPAA language on page. No promises, no medical advice. Store PHI securely.

> Pick the puddle with the right fish, call them out, show value, give the next step. That’s the whole game [$100M Leads, Page 127] [$100M Leads, Page 130].
