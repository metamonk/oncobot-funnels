## Troubleshooting

### Task Not Appearing
**Symptom:** Quiz submitted but no task created

**Checks:**
1. Is workflow ACTIVE? (toggle on)
2. Does opportunity have "quiz-submission" tag?
3. Is coordinator user assigned correctly?
4. Check workflow execution logs in GoHighLevel

**Fix:** Review trigger filters and test with sample opportunity

---

### Merge Tags Not Populating
**Symptom:** Task shows `{{contact.first_name}}` instead of actual name

**Checks:**
1. Do contact records have first_name field populated?
2. Are custom fields (cancer_type, zip_code) correctly named?
3. Check contact record data completeness

**Fix:** Ensure quiz form maps fields to correct contact properties

---

### Task Overload
**Symptom:** Too many tasks overwhelming coordinator

**Checks:**
1. What's the quiz submission rate? (expect 1-3 per day initially)
2. Is coordinator completing tasks promptly?
3. Are tasks auto-rescheduling correctly?

**Fix:**
- If high volume: Add second coordinator
- If low completion: Review training and script effectiveness
- If auto-reschedule issues: Check Action 3 workflow

---

## Integration Notes

### Connects To:
- **Action 2:** "Expect Our Call" SMS sends immediately after this task is created
- **Action 3:** Auto-dialer retry if no answer (or manual reschedule if using manual calling)
- **Actions 4-6:** Day 0 continued cadence if no contact

### Affects:
- Opportunity stage (updated after call)
- Contact tags (call outcome tags)
- Calendar bookings (BAMFAM technique)

---

## Manual Calling Alternative

**If NOT using auto-dialer:**

Coordinator process:
1. Task appears in dashboard with üö® priority
2. Coordinator clicks task to open
3. Clicks phone number to dial (or uses desk phone)
4. Follows script in task body
5. After call:
   - If NO ANSWER: Manually create new task "Retry call in 2 hours" (Action 3 replacement)
   - If ANSWERED: Complete task, add tags, update opportunity
6. Mark task complete

**No additional workflows needed** - This is simpler for low volume (15-30 leads)

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Results (First 30 Days)
- **Contact Rate:** 60-70% of leads reached
- **Average Time to First Contact:** <2 hours
- **Qualification Rate:** 40-50% of contacted leads
- **Appointment Booking Rate:** 70-80% of qualified leads

### Red Flags

## Next Action

After building this workflow, proceed to:
- **Action 2:** "Expect Our Call TODAY" SMS (sends simultaneously with this task)
- **Action 3:** Auto-dialer double-dial (or skip if using manual calling)
- **Actions 4-6:** Day 0 remaining cadence (Hour 3, Hours 4-5, end of day)
