## Tag Strategy for Day 0 Cadence

### Tags Used Across Actions 1-6

| Tag | When Applied | Purpose |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `quiz-submission` | Quiz completed | Triggers all workflows |
| `contacted` | Patient answers phone | Stops Day 0 cadence immediately |
| `no-answer-attempt-1` | First call, no answer | Tracking |
| `no-answer-attempt-2` | Second call, no answer | Tracking |
| `day0-complete-no-answer` | End of Day 0, still no answer | Moves to Day 1 cadence |
| `qualified-lead` | Patient qualifies during triage | High-value tag |
| `not-ready` | Patient not interested yet | Moves to nurture |

---

## Day 0 Complete: Transition to Day 1

**After Action 6 completes:**

**If patient was contacted:**
- ‚úÖ Tagged "contacted"
- ‚úÖ Opportunity moved to appropriate stage (Scheduled, Nurture, etc.)
- ‚úÖ No more Day 0 workflows fire
- ‚úÖ Patient proceeds to post-contact workflows (Actions 18-31)

**If patient was NOT contacted:**
- ‚ùå Tagged "day0-complete-no-answer"
- ‚ùå Opportunity remains in "New Lead" stage
- ‚ùå Patient enters Day 1-7 calling cadence (Actions 7-17)
- ‚ùå Day 1 workflows fire tomorrow at 9am

**Automated transition:** Actions 7-17 have trigger:
```yaml
Trigger: Opportunity Created + 1 day
Filters:
  - Tag contains: "day0-complete-no-answer"
  OR
  - Tag does NOT contain: "contacted"
  AND
  - Created_date >= 24 hours ago
```

---

## Success Criteria

### Action 4 (Hour 3 SMS)
- ‚úÖ SMS sends only if patient not yet contacted
- ‚úÖ Professional tone maintained
- ‚úÖ SMS doesn't send if patient was already reached

### Action 5 (Hour 4-5 Task)
- ‚úÖ Task created for coordinator retry
- ‚úÖ No excessive SMS (recommend skipping SMS here)
- ‚úÖ Script helps coordinator with positioning

### Action 6 (End of Day)
- ‚úÖ Final attempt before transitioning to Day 1
- ‚úÖ Clear decision point for coordinator
- ‚úÖ Patient smoothly transitions to Day 1 cadence if needed

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Day 0 Results
- **Contact Rate by End of Day 0:** 60-70%
  - 30-40% reached on first attempt (Actions 1-2)
  - 20-30% reached on subsequent attempts (Actions 4-6)

- **Attempts per Contact:** 2-3 average
  - Some patients answer first call
  - Others need 4-5 attempts

- **Time to Contact:**
  - 50% within first hour
  - 75% within 3 hours
  - 90% within 6 hours (if they'll answer at all on Day 0)

### Red Flags
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact rate <50% by end of Day 0 ‚Üí Phone number issues or timing problems
- ‚ö†Ô∏è >80% no-answer ‚Üí Bad phone numbers or wrong demographic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High opt-out rate from SMS ‚Üí Tone or frequency issues

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflows Firing When Patient Already Contacted
**Symptom:** Patient receives SMS or coordinator gets task even after patient was reached

**Cause:** "contacted" tag not being applied properly

**Fix:**
1. Verify coordinator is adding "contacted" tag after successful calls
2. Check workflow filters include "tag does NOT contain 'contacted'"
3. Add condition to each action to check for tag before executing

---

### Issue: Too Many SMS Messages
**Symptom:** Patients complaining about message frequency

**Current Day 0 SMS:**
- Hour 0: "Expect our call" (Action 2)
- Hour 3: "Still trying to reach you" (Action 4)
- Optional: Hour 4-5 (Action 5 - recommend skipping)
- Optional: End of day (Action 6 - recommend skipping)

**Fix:**
- Skip Actions 5 and 6 SMS components
- Only send 2 SMS on Day 0 (Actions 2 and 4)
- Rely on voicemail for later attempts

---

### Issue: Coordinator Overwhelmed with Tasks
**Symptom:** Too many retry tasks piling up

**Cause:** Tasks being created even after patient was reached, or too many active leads

**Fix:**
1. Ensure "contacted" tag stops workflows
2. Coordinator should mark tasks complete promptly
3. If genuinely too many leads: Add second coordinator or implement auto-dialer

---

## Integration Notes

### Connects To:
- **Actions 1-2:** These fire first (immediate call + SMS)
- **Action 3 (skipped):** Auto-dialer not needed for manual calling
- **Actions 7-17:** Day 1-7 cadence (fires if Day 0 unsuccessful)
- **Actions 18-31:** Post-contact workflows (fires if Day 0 successful)

### Day 0 ‚Üí Day 1 Transition Logic
```
IF end_of_day_0 AND tag = "contacted":
  ‚Üí Proceed to Actions 18-31 (post-contact workflows)

IF end_of_day_0 AND tag ‚â† "contacted":
  ‚Üí Add tag "day0-complete-no-answer"
  ‚Üí Proceed to Actions 7-17 (Day 1-7 calling cadence)
```

---

## Next Steps

After building Actions 1-6 (Day 0 complete cadence):

### Immediate:
1. Test all 6 actions with sample opportunity
2. Verify tag logic works (workflows stop when "contacted")
3. Train coordinator on Day 0 process

### Next Phase:
1. **Build Actions 7-17:** Day 1-7 calling cadence
   - Longer delays between attempts
   - Different messaging (less urgent)
   - Educational content mixed in

2. **Build Actions 18-31:** Post-contact workflows
   - Appointment reminders
   - No-show follow-up
   - Long-term nurture

## Summary

**Day 0 Cadence Overview:**

| Time | Action | Type | Status |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Hour 0 | Action 1: CALL NOW Task | Task | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Hour 0 | Action 2: Expect Call SMS | SMS | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Hour 0-2 | Manual calling attempts | Calls | ‚úÖ Complete (manual) |
| Hour 3 | Action 4: Still Trying SMS | SMS | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Hour 4-5 | Action 5: Retry Task | Task | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Hour 5-7 | Action 6: Final Attempt | Task + Voicemail | ‚úÖ Complete |

**After Day 0:**
- 60-70% of patients contacted
- 30-40% move to Day 1-7 cadence
- All patients have received 2-3 touchpoints minimum

**Your automation is now:**
- Ready to handle immediate response (Day 0)
- Ready to persist through no-answers
- Ready to transition smoothly to Day 1

**Next:** Build Days 1-7 cadence (Actions 7-17) for the 30-40% who weren't reached on Day 0.
