Gaps & Recommendations for Better Product Insights

  1. Missing User Feedback Loop

  - Gap: No explicit feedback collection on search results quality or AI responses
  - Recommendation: Add thumbs up/down feedback buttons on AI responses and search results
  - Implementation: Track sentiment with trackAIResponseQuality and add feedback UI

  2. Limited Error Tracking

  - Gap: No tracking of failed searches, API errors, or user frustration signals
  - Recommendation: Implement error boundary tracking and failed action monitoring
  - Implementation: Add error event tracking with context about what user was trying to do

  3. Search Intent Understanding

  - Gap: Not capturing why searches fail or what users expected
  - Recommendation: Track zero-result searches and add optional "What were you looking for?" prompt
  - Implementation: Enhanced search tracking with intent classification

  4. Health Profile Completion Funnel

  - Gap: Not tracking where users drop off in health profile creation
  - Recommendation: Add granular step tracking in health profile questionnaire
  - Implementation: Track each question answered/skipped with timing

  5. Progressive Criteria Usage

  - Gap: New feature (progressive disclosure) lacks analytics
  - Recommendation: Track expansion/collapse, search usage, copy actions
  - Implementation: Add event tracking to ProgressiveCriteria component

  6. Time to Value Metrics

  - Gap: Not measuring how quickly users find useful trials
  - Recommendation: Track time from first search to first contact initiated
  - Implementation: Add timing metrics between key actions

  7. Feature Discovery

  - Gap: No tracking of which features users discover organically
  - Recommendation: Track first-time usage of features with discovery source
  - Implementation: Add "feature discovered" events with referrer context

  8. User Segmentation

  - Gap: Limited user cohort definition
  - Recommendation: Segment users by cancer type, stage, location, treatment history
  - Implementation: Enhanced user properties from health profile

  9. Performance Metrics

  - Gap: No tracking of page load times, API response times
  - Recommendation: Add performance monitoring for key user journeys
  - Implementation: Track Web Vitals and custom performance marks

  10. Conversion Attribution

  - Gap: Not tracking which features/content lead to conversions
  - Recommendation: Add attribution tracking for contact initiations
  - Implementation: Track last interaction before conversion events

  Would you like me to implement any of these improvements? The highest impact would likely be:
  1. Adding feedback collection on AI responses
  2. Tracking the new Progressive Criteria feature usage
  3. Implementing health profile funnel tracking
  4. Adding error/frustration tracking
