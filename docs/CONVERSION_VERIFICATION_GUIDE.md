# Conversion Verification Guide - Multiple Checkpoints

## Overview
There are **5 places** you can verify if conversions are working, from immediate to delayed. Let's check each one.

## 🔍 Verification Points (In Order of Speed)

### 1. ✅ **Browser Console** (Immediate)
**What**: Check if conversion code fires when quiz is submitted
**When**: Real-time (immediate)
**Where**: Production site browser console

#### How To Check:
1. Go to https://trials.onco.bot
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
3. Complete a quiz submission
4. Look for these logs:

[Google Ads] ✅ Enhanced conversion fired {
  transactionId: "1736012345678",
  hasEmail: true,
  hasPhone: true,
  hasName: true,
  hasZip: true,
  conversionId: "AW-17578966440/YOUR_LABEL"
}
[GA4] Conversion fired { transactionId: "1736012345678" }
[Meta Pixel] Conversion fired
[Meta CAPI] Server-side conversion fired
[Conversion Tracker] ✅ All conversion events completed
```

**❌ PROBLEM (What you might see instead):**
```

## 🚨 Most Common Issues By Checkpoint

### Issue: "No console logs at all"

# Should be: f6cc887 or later
# If older: Wait for deployment or trigger redeploy
```

### Issue: "Logs show 'CONVERSION ID NOT SET'"
**Checkpoint Failed**: #1 (Console)
**Root Cause**: Environment variable not in build
**Solution**: Redeploy to bake in environment variables

### Issue: "Logs good, but no Network requests"
