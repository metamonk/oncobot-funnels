## Automatic Opportunity Creation

The system automatically creates opportunities when:
- A new contact is created via the eligibility quiz or booking form
- The pipeline IDs are properly configured in the environment
- Opportunities are placed in the appropriate initial stage based on lead quality

### Lead Scoring and Stage Placement

**Patient Leads:**
- High Score (80+): May skip to "Qualified" stage if they have advanced cancer + biomarkers/prior therapy
- Medium Score (60-79): Starts at "Pre-Screening" 
- Low Score (<60): Starts at "New Lead"

**Site Leads:**
- High Volume (100+ patients/month): Starts at "Qualified"
