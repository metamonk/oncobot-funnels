# Lead Automation & Follow-up Overview

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025

This document outlines all current automations, calling workflows, and follow-up processes for quiz submissions using a **high-velocity sales model** per the $100M Leads framework.

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Call-First, Not Email-First

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**

This is a **high-velocity sales pipeline**, not an email nurture campaign.

- ‚úÖ **Value delivery:** 5-minute triage call (NOT email with trial links)
- ‚úÖ **Speed:** Same-day contact via phone + SMS (NOT 24-48 hour email response)
- ‚úÖ **Method:** BAMFAM (Book A Meeting From A Meeting)
- ‚úÖ **Cadence:** Double-dial + text 3x Day 0; 2x/day Days 1-2; 1x/day Days 3-6

**Reference:** See `/STAGES.md` for complete sales process framework

---

## üìß Email Template Strategy (Revised)

### Email Templates to KEEP
1. **1-confirmation.tsx** - REWRITE to say "Expect Our Call TODAY"
2. **2-internal-notification.tsx** - REWRITE subject to "CALL NOW"
3. **6-longterm-nurture.tsx** - KEEP for unresponsive leads (quarterly emails)

### Email Templates to DELETE (Obsolete in Call-First Model)
4. **3-patient-results.tsx** - DELETE (trial matches delivered via phone, not email)
5. **4-followup-1week.tsx** - DELETE (replaced by Days 1-7 calling cadence)
6. **5-followup-1month.tsx** - DELETE (replaced by 14-day cutoff to nurture)

**Why Email-First Model Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå Low engagement: Email open rates <40%, reply rates <5%
- ‚ùå Slow conversion: 24-48 hour response time vs same-day phone contact
- ‚ùå Passive approach: Waiting for patient to respond vs proactive outreach
- ‚úÖ Call-first wins: 60%+ same-day contact rate, 30%+ enrollment rate

## üîç Verification: How to Check Current Automations

### 1. Check GoHighLevel CRM Sync

**Navigate to:**
```
GoHighLevel ‚Üí Contacts ‚Üí Search by email
```

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Contact exists with correct name/email/phone
- ‚úÖ Tags include: `quiz-submission`, `source:quiz`
- ‚úÖ Custom fields populated (last quiz date, preferred time)

**Check Opportunity:**
```
GoHighLevel ‚Üí Opportunities ‚Üí Filter by "Quiz"
```

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Opportunity created with name: `Quiz - [Name] (Date)`
- ‚úÖ Custom fields populated (cancer type, stage, biomarkers, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Status: Open
- ‚úÖ Stage: New Lead

---

### 2. Check Database Storage

**Option A: Drizzle Studio (Local)**
```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit studio
# Opens http://localhost:4983
# Browse quizSubmissions table
```

**Option B: Direct Database Query**
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  fullName,
  cancerType,
  stage,
  syncedToCrm,
  ghlContactId,
  ghlOpportunityId,
  createdAt
FROM quiz_submissions
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Submission saved with all quiz data
- ‚úÖ `syncedToCrm` = true
- ‚úÖ `ghlContactId` populated
- ‚úÖ `ghlOpportunityId` populated

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: CRM Sync Failing

**Check:**
1. GoHighLevel API token valid: `process.env.GHL_INTEGRATION_TOKEN`
2. Location ID correct: `process.env.GHL_LOCATION_ID`
3. Pipeline ID configured: `process.env.GHL_QUIZ_PIPELINE_ID`
4. Stage ID configured: `process.env.GHL_QUIZ_STAGE_NEW`

**Logs to check:**
```
Database: quiz_submissions table
  ‚îú‚îÄ syncedToCrm = false (indicates failure)
  ‚îî‚îÄ syncError = "[error message]" (shows what failed)
```

---

### Issue: Opportunities Not Being Created

**Most common cause:** Missing pipeline or stage configuration

**Fix:**
1. Go to GoHighLevel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pipelines
2. Find your quiz pipeline
3. Copy pipeline ID
4. Copy "New Lead" stage ID
5. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   ```
   GHL_QUIZ_PIPELINE_ID=pipeline_xxx
   GHL_QUIZ_STAGE_NEW=stage_xxx
   ```
