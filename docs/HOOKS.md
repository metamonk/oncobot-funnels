## One strategy: Build an awareness-based hook bank and run 2–3 at a time

Hooks do the heavy lifting—spend 80% of prep there. Write 50 across awareness levels, then test a few head-to-head. Below is your programmatic bank (placeholders in brackets) you can drop into ads and matching LP headlines [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 9] [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 29] [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 14].

## Awareness levels → hook templates
- Most Aware (offer-driven)
  - "2‑Minute [Indication] Trial Eligibility Check — Free & HIPAA‑secure"
  - "[Indication] Trials Near [City]? Check Eligibility Now"
  - "See Trials Accepting Patients This Month in [City]"
  - "Book a Quick Call to Review Your [Indication] Trial Options"
  [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 11]

- Product Aware (proof-driven)
  - "Free [Indication] trial eligibility check — HIPAA-secure"
  - "Get matched with relevant [Indication] trials near [City]"
  - "Connect with trial coordinators after eligibility check"
  [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 11]

- Solution Aware (promise-driven)
  - "Check if you qualify for a [Indication] trial near you"
  - "Newly diagnosed? Explore trial eligibility options"
  - "Had [chemo/immunotherapy]? Check trial eligibility"
  [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 11]

- Problem Aware (problem framing)
  - "Limited options? Explore local [Indication] trials in minutes"
  - "Stage [X] [Indication]? See nearby trials within [Miles] miles"
  - "Caregivers: quick check for [Indication] trial options near [City]"
  [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 11]

- Unaware (curiosity/context)
  - "Live near [Landmark/City]? See current [Indication] trials"
  - "Biomarker‑positive ([EGFR/ALK/BRCA/MSI‑H])? Check local trials"
  - "Second‑opinion path: quick [Indication] trial eligibility check"
  [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 13]

Match your LP headline to the ad verbatim for "click‑to‑close" continuity [$100M Leads, Page 141].

## Google Search ad templates (Callout + Value + CTA)
- H1: Do You Qualify for a [Indication] Trial? | H2: 2‑Minute Check (Free)
  - Desc: HIPAA‑secure. See local options fast. Start eligibility check →
- H1: [Indication] Trials Near [City] | H2: Check Eligibility Now
  - Desc: No obligation. Free eligibility check. Start now →
- H1: Biomarker‑Specific [Indication] Trials | H2: [EGFR/ALK/BRCA/MSI‑H]
  - Desc: See if you pre‑qualify today. Start the quick check now →
- H1: Newly Diagnosed [Indication]? | H2: See Local Trial Options
  - Desc: 2‑minute eligibility check. Free & secure. Begin →
- H1: Stage [X] [Indication] | H2: Trials Within [Miles] Miles
  - Desc: Quick eligibility check. Free & secure →

Structure every ad as Callout + Value + CTA. Then mirror the exact headline on the LP [$100M Leads, Page 130] [$100M Leads, Page 142] [$100M Leads, Page 141].

## Variables for your programmatic bank
- [Indication], [City], [ZIP], [Miles], [Stage], [Biomarker], [Therapy], [Caregiver/Self], [Month].

## How to test (tight)
- Run 2–3 hooks at once (not 50). After ~10 quiz completes per variant, crown the winner as your control; add new challengers weekly [$100M Offers, Page 143].
- KPI = lowest Cost per Quiz Complete (secondary: Click→Quiz Start, Completion). Keep ad→LP identical.

## Guardrails
- Neutral claims only (no medical promises). HIPAA language on page.
- One funnel for all: ad → indication LP → quiz → eligibility results → optional coordinator contact.

## Call to action
Load these templates, launch 2–3 hooks per indication, and match the LP headline verbatim. Review results weekly and keep iterating your control with new challengers as you build your 50‑hook bank [$100M Playbook: GOATed Ads, Page 29] [$100M Leads, Page 141] [$100M Leads, Page 130].

## Important Notes
- Headlines must match ads exactly for continuity (line 37, 51)
- We provide eligibility checking, not automatic matching
- All claims must be factual and verifiable
- Avoid medical promises or guaranteed outcomes
- Supporting text can rotate, but main headline must match ad campaign
