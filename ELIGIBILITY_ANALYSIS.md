 After analyzing the codebase, here's how the eligibility determination system works:

  1. Data Flow Architecture

  The system follows this flow:
  User Query → Query Interpretation → API Search → Trial Retrieval → Relevance Scoring → Eligibility
  Analysis → Results

  2. API Data Structure

  The ClinicalTrials.gov API returns trials with an eligibilityModule containing:
  eligibilityModule?: {
    eligibilityCriteria?: string;  // Full text of inclusion/exclusion criteria
    sex?: string;
    minimumAge?: string;
    maximumAge?: string;
  }

  Key Finding: The API provides eligibility criteria as a single unstructured text field
  (eligibilityCriteria), not as parsed inclusion/exclusion lists.


3. Current Eligibility Analysis Process

  The system performs a simplified pattern-matching analysis rather than parsing the full criteria:

  a) Profile-Based Matching (lines 308-325)

  - Checks if molecular markers from the health profile appear in trial title/summary
  - Matches cancer type against trial conditions
  - Creates "inclusion matches" based on these pattern matches

  b) No Actual Criteria Parsing

  - The full eligibility text is intentionally excluded from responses (line 362)
  - Marked as "Available" or "Not specified" but not analyzed
  - This is to reduce token usage since criteria can be very long

  c) Eligibility Analysis Structure

  eligibilityAnalysis = {
    likelyEligible: true,  // Always defaults to true for matched trials
    inclusionMatches: [],   // Based on keyword matches, not actual criteria
    exclusionConcerns: [],  // Currently not populated
    uncertainFactors: []    // Only adds "not yet recruiting" warning
  }

  4. How Matching Actually Works

  Instead of parsing eligibility criteria, the system:

  1. Uses RelevanceScorer to rank trials based on:
    - Mutation matches in title/summary (50-80 points)
    - Cancer type matches (15 points)
    - Stage matches (10 points)
    - Trial phase and recruitment status
  2. Creates "Pseudo-Eligibility" Matches:
    - If KRAS mutation in profile and "KRAS" in trial title → "KRAS mutation match"
    - If lung cancer in profile and trial mentions it → "lung cancer diagnosis match"
  3. Does NOT:
    - Parse inclusion/exclusion criteria into structured lists
    - Check age, sex, or other demographic requirements
    - Verify prior treatment requirements
    - Analyze performance status requirements
    - Check organ function requirements

  5. Why This Approach?

  The code comments and structure reveal the reasoning:

  1. Token Optimization: Full eligibility criteria can be thousands of words
  2. API Limitations: ClinicalTrials.gov provides unstructured text, not parsed criteria
  3. Complexity: Parsing medical criteria requires sophisticated NLP
  4. User Experience: Shows relevant trials quickly, lets users investigate details

	6. Backup System (Commented Out)

  There's a backup file (clinical-trials.backup.ts) with more sophisticated eligibility analysis that:
  - Uses AI to parse criteria
  - Analyzes inclusion/exclusion separately
  - Provides detailed eligibility reasoning

  But this was replaced with the simpler system for performance.

  7. Key Limitations

  1. No Real Eligibility Checking: The "eligibility analysis" is mostly cosmetic
  2. False Positives: May show trials users aren't actually eligible for
  3. Missing Exclusions: Doesn't check exclusion criteria at all
  4. Demographic Blind: Ignores age, sex, and other basic requirements

  8. Improvement Opportunities

  To properly analyze eligibility, the system would need to:
  1. Parse the unstructured eligibilityCriteria text into inclusion/exclusion lists
  2. Match each criterion against the health profile
  3. Use NLP or AI to understand medical terminology
  4. Provide confidence scores for eligibility assessments
  5. Explain why users may or may not be eligible
