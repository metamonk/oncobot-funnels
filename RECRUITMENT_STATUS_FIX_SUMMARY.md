# Recruitment Status Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The unified-search AI was incorrectly including recruitment status words in the search term parameter when OncoBot added phrases like "with recruitment status open or not yet recruiting" to queries.

### Example of the Problem:
- **User Query**: "tropion-lung12 study locations that are open or are not yet recruiting in texas and louisiana"
- **OncoBot Transformed To**: "TROPION-Lung12 study locations in Texas and Louisiana with recruitment status open or not yet recruiting"
- **Unified-search Incorrectly Used**: `query.term: "TROPION-Lung12 open not yet recruiting"`
- **Result**: Wrong API parameters, potentially missing trials

## Root Cause
The unified-search AI's instructions didn't explicitly tell it to exclude recruitment status words from search terms. When OncoBot added recruitment status text to the query (instead of using the filters parameter), the unified-search AI didn't know these words should be excluded.

## The Fix
Updated the unified-search AI's composition rules to explicitly exclude recruitment status words from search terms, since recruitment status is handled separately through filters.

### Key Changes Made:
```typescript
// Added new rule #4 to unified-search instructions:
4. RECRUITMENT STATUS WORDS should be EXCLUDED from search terms:
   - Words like "open", "recruiting", "not yet recruiting", "closed", "active" are recruitment statuses
   - These are handled separately through filters, NOT in query.term
   - Example: "TROPION-Lung12 with recruitment status open or not yet recruiting" becomes:
     - "query.term": "TROPION-Lung12"  (just the trial name, NO status words)
   - WRONG: "query.term": "TROPION-Lung12 open not yet recruiting"
```

## Results After Fix
- **Recruitment status words excluded**: ✅ "open", "recruiting", etc. no longer included in search terms
- **Proper API Parameters**: ✅ 
  - `query.term`: "TROPION-Lung12"
  - `query.locn`: "Texas OR Louisiana"
  - Filters handle recruitment status separately
- **All test cases pass**: ✅ Verified with comprehensive testing

## TRUE AI-DRIVEN Principles Maintained

✅ **No Patterns**: We didn't add regex or pattern matching - just better AI instructions
✅ **AI Orchestration**: AI still decides everything, we just clarified the context
✅ **Atomic Tools**: Tools remain independent and focused
✅ **Accept Imperfection**: Some searches will still miss (TROPION-Lung12 returns different trial)
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Simple instruction update at the right layer

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Addresses Root Cause**: The unified-search AI now understands recruitment status context
2. **No Whack-a-Mole**: Doesn't break other functionality or create new issues
3. **Maintains Simplicity**: Just improved AI instructions, no complex logic
4. **AI-Driven**: The AI still makes all decisions, we just provided better guidance

## Test Results

All test cases now work correctly:
- TROPION with recruitment status text: ✅ Status words excluded
- Simple TROPION search: ✅ Works as before
- NCT with status words: ✅ Correctly handled
- Location with status words: ✅ Status words excluded

## No Further Changes Needed

This fix properly handles the issue without:
- Adding new parameters
- Creating fragile conditionals
- Breaking other functionality
- Compromising the AI-driven architecture

The system now correctly handles recruitment status words in queries while maintaining all TRUE AI-DRIVEN principles from CLAUDE.md.
