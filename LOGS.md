Called Tool:  health_profile

Called Tool:  clinical_trials
Warnings:  []

Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "What clinical trials are available near me?" This is a search query, so I correctly used the clinical_trials tool.

The tool's response shows: {"success":true,"matches":[],"totalCount":0,"message":"Found 0 studies"} This means no trials were found that match the query based on the user's profile.

I need to handle this gracefully. As per my instructions, I shouldn't leave the user empty-handed. I should offer helpful suggestions, like refining the search or providing general information.

Key points from my system prompt:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- If the search returns no results, suggest next steps.
- Always remind users that this is for educational purposes and to consult their healthcare provider.
- Since no trials were found, I could suggest using the clinical_trials_info tool for educational content or ask for more details.

The tool might have used the user's health profile, which includes location, but if nothing was found, perhaps the location is too specific or there's no match.

Possible responses:
- Acknowledge the result: "I didn't find any trials matching your criteria."
- Suggest refinements: Ask if they want to broaden the search, e.g., to a larger area or different criteria.
- Offer educational info: Redirect to general information about trials.
- Check if more details are needed: Since the profile is complete, maybe ask if they want to update it.

From the prompt: "The tool has automatic fallbacks for missing profiles" and "Provides helpful resources on errors" ‚Äì so I can build on that.

Structure my response:
1. Start with empathy and summary: "I'm sorry, but I didn't find any clinical trials near you that match your profile."
2. Explain why: Possibly due to the specific criteria in their profile.
3. Suggest next steps: 
   - Ask for clarification or refinement of the search.
   - Offer to provide general information using clinical_trials_info.
   - Remind them to consult their doctor.
4. End positively, encouraging further conversation.

Finally, include the standard disclaimer.

Response format: Keep it clear and not verbose.

      '- Use the **clinical_trials** tool for searching or looking up specific trials, especially when it involves location.\n' +

      'Once I have that information, I can proceed to the clinical_trials search.\n' +
      '\n' +
      `The user's query includes "near me", which implies location. The clinical_trials tool can handle location-based searches, but I might need to infer or ask for more details if not available.

      '\n' +
      `In the function call for clinical_trials, there's an optional userLatitude and userLongitude, but it's not required. The parameters are: required ["query"], so I can just pass the query.\n` +

      "To make it more accurate, if I had the user's location, I could include it, but I don't from this message.\n" +

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"What clinical trials are available near me?"},{"role":"user","content":"What clinical trials are available near me?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.
