## User-Facing Privacy Policy

### Our Commitment to Privacy

OncoBot is designed with privacy at its core. We collect only the data necessary to provide and improve our clinical trial search services. **We never sell your data to third parties**, and we never use your health information for advertising.

### Information We Collect

- IP addresses
- Precise location data
- Cross-site tracking information

#### 2. Clinical Trial Interactions
To improve our matching and recommendation system, we track:
