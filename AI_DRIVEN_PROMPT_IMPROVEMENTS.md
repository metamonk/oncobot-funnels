# AI-Driven System Prompt Improvements

## üéØ Overview

Improved the system prompt to be truly AI-driven, removing myopic patterns and enabling natural understanding of user intent without rigid rules.

## üö® What Was Wrong

### Previous Issues:
1. **Myopic Pattern**: "When user says 'just show me trials' - go straight to clinical_trials tool"
2. **Forced Health Profile Checks**: "ALWAYS check health profile first"
3. **Rigid Patterns**: Specific phrases hardcoded instead of intent understanding

These violated our TRUE AI-DRIVEN principles by introducing:
- Hardcoded patterns that would miss variations
- Fragile conditionals that could break
- Limited intelligence by prescribing exact behaviors

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Myopic Patterns**
**Before**: "When user says 'just show me trials' or similar"
**After**: "**UNDERSTAND INTENT**: The AI should naturally understand various ways users express urgency or directness"

### 2. **Enhanced AI Intelligence**
Instead of patterns, we now guide the AI to understand:
- User intent naturally without rigid patterns
- Various ways people express the same need
- Complex queries and follow-ups
- Multiple NCT IDs in one query

### 3. **Expanded Capabilities Documentation**
Added clear documentation that the system handles:
```
‚Ä¢ Direct trial lookups: Multiple NCT IDs, specific trial names
‚Ä¢ Location queries: "Any in Brooklyn?", "Which ones are in Texas?"
‚Ä¢ Eligibility questions: "What would prevent me from joining?", "Am I eligible?"
‚Ä¢ Trial details: Contact info, phases, interventions, exclusion criteria
‚Ä¢ Comparative questions: "Which is closest?", "Which is best for KRAS G12C?"
```

### 4. **Multi-NCT Support**
Enhanced the orchestrator to handle multiple NCT IDs:
```
IMPORTANT: For multiple NCT IDs, create multiple executions (one per ID)
Example for multiple: If user provides 10 NCT IDs, create 10 nct-lookup executions
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Maintained

### TRUE AI-DRIVEN Principles Preserved
- ‚úÖ **No patterns** - AI understands intent naturally
- ‚úÖ **No fallbacks** - Trust AI intelligence
- ‚úÖ **Pure orchestration** - AI decides everything
- ‚úÖ **Atomic tools** - Each tool remains single-purpose

## üìä What This Enables

The system can now handle endless variations naturally:

### User says "just show me" ‚Üí AI understands urgency
- "just show me the trials"
- "please just show me"
- "stop talking and show trials"
- "I want to see them now"
- Any other natural variation

### User provides multiple NCT IDs ‚Üí AI processes them all
- "NCT05638295, NCT04595559, NCT03775265"
- "Find these: [10 NCT IDs pasted]"
- "Look up NCT05638295 and NCT04595559"

### User asks complex follow-ups ‚Üí AI understands context
- "Do any of these have locations in Brooklyn?"
- "What would prevent me from joining?"
- "Which is best for my mutation?"
- "Are any of these phase 3?"

## üß™ Test Script

Created `/scripts/test-ai-driven-queries.ts` to demonstrate:
1. Various ways to express urgency (no patterns needed)
2. Multiple NCT ID handling
3. Complex combined queries
4. Follow-up questions
5. Natural language variations

## üéØ Key Insight

**This is a SYSTEM PROMPT issue, not a DESIGN issue**

The design is already perfect - purely AI-driven with atomic tools. The prompt just needed to:
1. Stop prescribing specific patterns
2. Guide AI to understand intent
3. Document capabilities without hardcoding behaviors
4. Trust AI intelligence

## ‚ú® Result

The system now:
- Handles infinite query variations through AI understanding
- Processes multiple NCT IDs naturally
- Answers complex follow-ups intelligently
- Maintains TRUE AI-DRIVEN architecture
- Avoids all fragile, hardcoded patterns

**Bottom Line**: We improved the prompt to guide AI intelligence, not restrict it with patterns.
