Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I called the clinical_trials tool with the appropriate query, and now I'm receiving the response from that function call.

The response from the clinical_trials tool includes a list of trials that match the user's profile and the location filter for Chicago. It shows 70 trials in total, with the top 5 detailed.

Key elements from the response:
- Total trials: 70
- Filtered by Chicago
- Top 5 trials are provided, each with details like NCT ID, title, status, why it matches, locations, etc.
- Some trials have sites in Chicago, as indicated in the locationSummary for NCT04613596.

In my response, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Summarize the results.
- Present the key details clearly.
- Acknowledge the user's profile (NSCLC, KRAS G12C, Stage III).
- Highlight matches, especially for mutations.
- Remind that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.
- Offer next steps or ask if they need more information.

Structure my response:
1. **Start with a summary:** Acknowledge the search and what was found.
2. **Present the trials:** List the top 5 as in the tool's response, grouping by relevance and proximity.
3. **Mention why they match:** Reference the profile.
4. **Handle locations:** Note which ones are near Chicago.
5. **End with guidance:** Ask if they want more details or refinements.

From the tool's response:
- NCT05398094: No Chicago sites, but in Spain.
- NCT05375994: No Chicago sites, in US but not Chicago.
- NCT04613596: Has sites in Chicago! (e.g., Arlington Heights, Chicago, etc.)
- NCT04585035: No Chicago sites.
- NCT06343402: No Chicago sites.

So, only NCT04613596 has sites in Chicago. I should highlight that.

Finally, end with the standard disclaimer and an offer for more help.
