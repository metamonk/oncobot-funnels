Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for their type and stage of cancer. From the function call response, I see that the tool used the health profile, which indicates the user has NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, as that's what's being matched in the trials.

Key points from the response:
- It found 70 trials, showing 10 most relevant.
- Matches are based on KRAS G12C mutation and cancer type (NSCLC).
- I need to present this information warmly, supportively, and informatively.
- Acknowledge the specific information from their profile: cancer type (NSCLC) and molecular markers (KRAS G12C).
- Highlight trials that target the user's mutations, which most of these do.
- Start with a summary, present key details, and explain why they match.
- End with the standard disclaimer.

Structure my response:
1. **Summary**: Start with a positive, supportive summary of what was found.
2. **Acknowledge Profile**: Mention that I'm using their NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation from their profile.
3. **Present Trials**: Summarize the top trials briefly, grouping by relevance. Don't list all 10 in detail; keep it concise.
4. **Offer Next Steps**: Suggest ways to get more info, like more results or filtering by location.
5. **Disclaimer**: Remind them this is for educational purposes and to consult their doctor.

Since there are 70 results, I should note it's a broad set and suggest refinements.

Finally, end with the disclaimer.

Ensure the response is not verbose.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (SUPER SIMPLE!):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - Pass the user's query directly - it understands everything!\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I already called the clinical_trials tool with that query, and now I'm receiving the response from that function call.

The response contains a list of trials that match the user's profile and the location filter. It includes details like NCT IDs, titles, locations, and how they match the user's criteria.

My role is to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way. I need to:

- Start with a summary of what I found.

- Acknowledge the user's profile (e.g., NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation).

- Present the key details clearly.

- Highlight why each trial matches.

- Group or prioritize by relevance, especially proximity to Chicago.

- Remind them that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.

From the function response:

- It found 47 trials with sites in or near Chicago.

- It's showing the top 10.

- For each trial, there's matchScore, eligibilityAnalysis, and locationSummary.

I should:

1. Summarize: "I found 47 trials that match your profile and are located in or near Chicago. Here are the top 10 based on proximity and relevance."

2. Reference the user's profile: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."

3. Present the trials: List them with key details like NCT ID, title, why it matches, phase, status, and locations near Chicago.

4. If a trial has sites in Chicago, highlight that.

5. End with next steps: Offer to provide more details or refine the search.

Finally, include the standard disclaimer.

Structure the response:

- Introduction

- Summary of results

- List of top trials

- Closing remarks
