Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "What trials are available in Chicago for KRAS?" This is a search query for specific trials, so I should use the clinical_trials tool, which I did.

The function response shows: {"success":true,"trials":[],"matches":[],"totalCount":0}. That means no trials were found matching the query.

I need to handle this gracefully. As per my instructions, I shouldn't leave the user empty-handed. I should:

- Acknowledge the search results.

- Suggest possible reasons why no trials were found.

- Offer alternatives, like suggesting to broaden the search or check for updates.

- Remind them that this is based on current data.

Since the user's health profile is complete, I should reference that I used it for personalization.

Key points from instructions:

- When presenting search results, start with a summary.

- Always mention why trials match the user's profile, but in this case, there are none.

- Be compassionate and supportive.

- End with the standard disclaimer.

Possible reasons for no results:

- No active trials in Chicago for KRAS at the moment.

- The query might need refinement, e.g., specify cancer type if not in profile.

- Trials could be elsewhere, or not recruiting.

I can suggest using the clinical_trials_info tool to educate them more, or ask if they'd like to search in a different location or for related topics.

Finally, structure my response:

- Be warm and conversational.

- Summarize what I did.

- Explain the results.

- Provide next steps.

- Include the disclaimer.

The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"What trials are available in Chicago for KRAS?"},{"role":"user","content":"What trials are available in Chicago for KRAS?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

      "Unfortunately, my search didn't turn up any active clinical trials in Chicago that match your query for KRAS mutations right now. This could be due to a few reasons, such as trials not currently recruiting in that location, changes in availability, or the need for more specific criteria. Remember, clinical trial landscapes can evolve quickly, so it's worth checking back periodically.\n" +
