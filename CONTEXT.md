Reasoning:  First, the user queried about "kras g12c trials chicago," and I've just received the results from the clinical_trials function call. The response shows 5 trials out of 13410 total matches, with details like NCT IDs, titles, summaries, locations, and relevance to the user's profile.

My role is to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way. I need to:

- Start with a summary of what I found.

- Highlight key details: name, phase, status, brief description.

- ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile, especially if it targets KRAS G12C.

- Acknowledge the user's profile details, like their NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation.

- Remind them that this is for educational purposes and they should consult their healthcare provider.

- Be conversational and offer next steps, like asking if they want more details or more results.

Key elements from the response:

- Total trials: 13410, but I'm showing the first 5.

- Trials include NCT02259582, NCT00003666, etc.

- Some trials have locations in Chicago, which matches the query.

- Relevance scores: Around 0.75-0.85, indicating good matches.

- User's profile: NSCLC, Stage IV, KRAS G12C positive, etc.

Structure my response:

1. **Introduction/Summary:** "I found X trials that might be relevant based on your KRAS G12C mutation and location in Chicago. Using your health profile, I've prioritized ones that match your NSCLC diagnosis."

2. **Present Trials:** For each trial, briefly cover:

   - NCT ID

   - Title

   - Phase and status

   - Key locations (especially in Chicago)

   - Why it matches (e.g., targets KRAS G12C, matches stage)

   - Brief description

3. **General Advice:** End with a reminder about not providing medical advice, suggest next steps (e.g., "Would you like more details on a specific trial?" or "Show me more results?").

4. **Handle Volume:** There are 13410 results, which is a lot. I should note that and suggest refining the search if needed.

Finally, decide if I need to call another function. The user's request seems fulfilled for now, but I can prepare for follow-ups. No immediate function call needed unless I ask a question that requires it.

Response should be clear and not verbose.

The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes.
