Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for their type and stage of cancer. From the function call response, I see that the user's health profile indicates NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, as the trials are matched to that.

I need to present the results in a warm, supportive, and informative way. Start with a summary, highlight key details, and explain why they match the user's profile.

Key elements from my instructions:
- Acknowledge the specific information from their profile: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."
- If stage is missing, mention it, but the response seems to have used it, so I'll check.
- Highlight trials that target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C).
- Group by relevance: The tool already returned the most relevant first.
- Mention eligibility indicators.
- Always include the disclaimer.

The response from the tool:
- Found 120 trials, showing 10 most relevant.
- Each trial has details like NCT ID, title, status, locations, and matching criteria.
- Matching criteria emphasize KRAS G12C mutation.

Structure my response:
1. **Summary**: "I found 120 clinical trials that might be relevant based on your health profile, which includes NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation. I'm showing the top 10 here."
2. **Acknowledge profile**: Explicitly state what's being used.
3. **Present trials**: Summarize key details for each, focusing on why they match.
4. **Offer next steps**: Suggest asking for more details, more results, or filtering by location.
5. **Disclaimer**: End with the standard reminder.

If the stage was used, great; if not, I should check. The tool's response says "searchCriteria":{"condition":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?","useProfile":true,"cancerType":"NSCLC"} ‚Äì it mentions cancerType as NSCLC, but doesn't explicitly confirm stage. In my initial function call, I used the profile, so I'll assume it's incorporated. If needed, I can suggest updating.

Finally, end with the disclaimer.

Keep it concise and clear.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (SUPER SIMPLE!):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - Pass the user's query directly - it understands everything!\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I called the clinical_trials tool with the appropriate query, and now I have the response.

The response from the tool includes a list of trials that were filtered based on the query. It shows 81 trials in total, with details on the top 10. Key points from the response:
- It's based on the previous search.
- Filtered by proximity to Chicago.
- Each trial has details like NCT ID, phase, status, and why it matches the user's profile.
- Some trials have sites in Chicago, as indicated by "hasTargetLocation": true for some.

I need to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way, as per my role.

Structure my response:
1. **Start with a summary**: Acknowledge the refinement and summarize what was found.
2. **Reference the user's profile**: Mention how it's using their profile details, like NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutation.
3. **Present the trials**: Summarize the top trials clearly, including key details. Group or highlight based on relevance.
4. **Highlight matches**: Emphasize trials that target the user's mutations.
5. **End with next steps**: Offer to provide more details, refine further, or answer questions.
6. **Disclaimer**: Remind that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.

Key from the tool's response:
- Total trials: 81
- Showing top 10
- Some have sites in Chicago (e.g., NCT04793958 has 4 sites in Chicago)

In my presentation:
- List the top 10 trials briefly.
- For each, include: NCT ID, phase, status, brief description, why it matches, and location proximity.
- Since it's filtered by Chicago, note the distance or availability.

Keep it concise: The instructions say to keep responses clear and not verbose.

Finally, end by asking if they want more information.
