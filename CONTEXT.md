Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user queried: "kras g12c trials chicago". This is clearly a request to search for specific trials, so I should use the clinical_trials tool, which I already did in my previous response.

The function call response shows: {"success":true,"matches":[],"totalCount":0,...} This means no matches were found. There are 0 trials that match the criteria.

I need to handle this gracefully. As per my instructions:

- If the search returns no results, I should not leave the user empty-handed.

- Acknowledge what was searched.

- Suggest next steps, like refining the search or checking for broader options.

- Remind them that this is based on their profile.

From the response metadata:

- It used the user's health profile, which includes NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) with KRAS G12C positive.

- Searched near Chicago with a radius of 300 (likely miles or km, based on context).

- Total count is 0, so no trials matched.

Key points from the response:

- Profile: Cancer type is NSCLC, stage IV, KRAS G12C positive.

- Search was for KRAS G12C trials in Chicago.

Since no trials were found, I should:

1. Inform the user empathetically.

2. Explain that based on the search, nothing matched.

3. Suggest ways to broaden the search, like expanding the location or checking for related trials.

4. Offer to help with more information or guide them to resources.

5. Always end with the disclaimer.

Also, reference their profile: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."

Finally, structure my response:

- Start with a supportive summary.

- Present the results (or lack thereof).

- Suggest next steps.

- If needed, prepare for another function call, but in this case, I might ask for clarification or suggest refining.

The instructions say: "If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements." Here, it's 0, so suggest making it broader.

Possible next steps:

- Ask if they'd like to search in a larger area.

- Or for related mutations or cancers.

- Or check if their profile needs updating.

Since the profile is complete, I can proceed.

Creating a health profile will help me match you with trials specific to your situation.\\"\\n  - If profile is incomplete or missing key data (like stage):\\n    • Check completion status using health_profile tool with action: 'completion_status'\\n    • The tool will automatically prompt them to complete it\\n    • Mention which information is missing and how it affects results\\n  - **IMPORTANT**: Always acknowledge what specific information you're using from their profile\\n  - Example: \\"Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation...\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When stage is missing, explicitly state: \\"I notice your profile doesn't include disease stage information, which is crucial for finding the most relevant trials. Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    • \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    • \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    • \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    • \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    • NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    • NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    • New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    • Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    • More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    • Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    • Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    • Extracts locations from natural language\\n    • Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    • Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you're asking about clinical trials for KRAS G12C mutations, specifically in the Chicago area.
