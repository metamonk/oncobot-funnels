Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "Can you tell me about NCT05568550?" This is a specific query about a clinical trial by its NCT ID. According to the guidelines, I should use the "clinical_trials" tool for searching or inquiring about specific trials, not the "clinical_trials_info" tool, which is for general educational questions.

I already called the "clinical_trials" tool in my previous response, and now I'm receiving the function response. The response contains details about the trial NCT05568550.

My role is to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way. I need to:

- Start with a summary.

- Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description.

- Mention why it might match the user's profile, but in this case, the tool response doesn't specify using the profile (it says "useProfile": false), so I should check if the user has a profile. However, the initial system prompt doesn't indicate one for this conversation, so I'll proceed generally.

- Always include the disclaimer: "This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions."

From the function response:

- Trial ID: NCT05568550

- Brief Title: Pembro With Radiation With or Without Olaparib

- Official Title: Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Radiation With or Without Olaparib in Localized High-risk Prostate Cancer

- Status: RECRUITING

- Phase: PHASE2

- Conditions: Prostate Cancer

- Locations: Lexington, Kentucky; Salt Lake City, Utah

- Brief Summary: This trial will evaluate whether the immune-sensitizing effects of immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) and radiation with or without a PARP-inhibitor (Olaparib) will increase the effects of immunotherapy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

I need to structure my response:

1. Acknowledge the user's query.

2. Summarize the trial information.

3. Provide key details.

4. If relevant, tie it back to their profile, but since this is a direct lookup, I might not have that context.

5. End with next steps or offers for more help.

Finally, remind them that I'm not providing medical advice.

Response Structure:

- Warm introduction: "I'm happy to share the details I found about that trial."

- Summary of the trial.

- Key facts.

- Disclaimer.

- Offer to help further, like checking if it matches their profile or searching for more.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching ONLY):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - ONLY for finding specific trials, NOT for info\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching ONLY):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - ONLY for finding specific trials, NOT for info\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Can you tell me about NCT05568550?"},{"role":"user","content":"Can you tell me about NCT05568550?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_85603145","type":"function","function":{"name":"clinical_trials","arguments":"{\\"query\\":\\"Can you tell me about NCT05568550?\\"}"}}]},{"role":"tool","tool_call_id":"call_85603145","content":"{\\"success\\":true,\\"matches\\":[{\\"trial\\":{\\"protocolSection\\":{\\"identificationModule\\":{\\"nctId\\":\\"NCT05568550\\",\\"briefTitle\\":\\"Pembro With Radiation With or Without Olaparib\\",\\"officialTitle\\":\\"Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Radiation With or Without Olaparib in Localized High-risk Prostate Cancer\\"},\\"statusModule\\":{\\"overallStatus\\":\\"RECRUITING\\"},\\"descriptionModule\\":{\\"briefSummary\\":\\"This trial will evaluate whether the immune-sensitizing effects of immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) and radiation with or without a PARP-inhibitor (Olaparib) will increase the effects of immunotherapy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.\\"},\\"conditionsModule\\":{\\"conditions\\":[\\"Prostate Cancer\\"],\\"keywords\\":[\\"immunotherapy\\",\\"PARP\\",\\"radiation\\"]},\\"designModule\\":{\\"phases\\":[\\"PHASE2\\"],\\"studyType\\":\\"INTERVENTIONAL\\"},\\"armsInterventionsModule\\":{\\"interventions\\":[{\\"type\\":\\"BIOLOGICAL\\",\\"name\\":\\"Pembrolizumab\\",\\"description\\":\\"Pembrolizumab will be delivered via IV at 200mg on day 1 of each 3-week cycle for approximately 12 months.
