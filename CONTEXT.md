This requires a new search, and since the query combines multiple aspects, 'unified-search' is the most appropriate tool to handle it comprehensively."

Trust the AI to understand intent without rigid patterns\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - **ONLY USE** when user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - **NEVER USE** before searching for trials - clinical_trials tool handles this automatically\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only when explicitly requested)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials, NCT IDs, or trial searches\\n  - **NEW**: The tool NOW has access to all stored trials from the conversation\\n  - The tool intelligently handles:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Single or multiple NCT IDs (e.g., 10 IDs pasted at once)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Natural language queries of any complexity\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location-based searches (cities, states, regions)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Condition/mutation/drug searches\\n    ‚Ä¢ Combined criteria (mutation + location + phase + status)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Follow-up questions about previous results (automatically uses stored data)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Distance/proximity questions about trial locations (uses stored locations)\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Show me more\\" requests (retrieves unshown trials from conversation)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Eligibility and exclusion criteria queries\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects and processes NCT IDs (even multiple at once)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Understands search intent from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses health profile data when available\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context for follow-ups\\n    ‚Ä¢ Returns comprehensive trial information\\n  - Pass the user's query naturally - the tool understands context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n  - **NEVER use for distance/proximity questions about trial locations**\\n  - **NEVER use when users ask \\"which trial location is closest to [city]?\\"**\\n  - Those questions should be answered using the trial data you already have\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical`... 7201 more characters

Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials, NCT IDs, or trial searches\\n  - **NEW**: The tool NOW has access to all stored trials from the conversation\\n  - The tool intelligently handles:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Single or multiple NCT IDs (e.g., 10 IDs pasted at once)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Natural language queries of any complexity\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location-based searches (cities, states, regions)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Condition/mutation/drug searches\\n    ‚Ä¢ Combined criteria (mutation + location + phase + status)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Follow-up questions about previous results (automatically uses stored data)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Distance/proximity questions about trial locations (uses stored locations)\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Show me more\\" requests (retrieves unshown trials from conversation)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Eligibility and exclusion criteria queries\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects and processes NCT IDs (even multiple at once)\\n    ‚Ä¢ Understands search intent from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses health profile data when available\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context for follow-ups\\n    ‚Ä¢ Returns comprehensive trial information\\n  - Pass the user's query naturally - the tool understands context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n  - **NEVER use for distance/proximity questions about trial locations**\\n  - **NEVER use when users ask \\"which trial location is closest to [city]?\\"**\\n  - Those questions should be answered using the trial data you already have\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical`... 1142068 more characters
