Search results: 102 unique trials from 7 queries
Warnings:  []
Warnings:  []
Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for their type and stage of cancer. From the function call response, I see the tool used the health profile, which includes NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutation, as it's highlighting matches based on that.

Key details from the response:
- The user's profile likely has: Cancer type: NSCLC, Molecular markers: KRAS G12C, and possibly Stage III based on the matches.
- The search returned 102 trials, but only 5 are shown here.
- Trials are matched based on exact criteria like KRAS G12C and NSCLC.

In my response, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Acknowledge the information from their profile: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."
- Summarize the results: "I found X trials..."
- Present key details clearly: Name, phase, status, brief description.
- Highlight trials that target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C).
- Group by relevance: The tool already did this.
- Mention why each trial matches.
- Always include the disclaimer.
- If stage is missing, I need to check and mention it, but from the matches, it's using stage, so perhaps it's in the profile.

From the system prompt: "When stage is missing, explicitly state..." But in the response, it's matching to Stage III, so I'll assume it's in the profile. To be thorough, I should confirm if the profile has stage.

In the function call, I set useProfile: true, so it's using whatever is there. The response says "Exact match for KRAS G12C mutation, NSCLC focus, and Stage III unresectable aligns with patient profile," so stage is likely in the profile.

Structure my response:
1. Start with a summary: "I found 102 trials that might be relevant based on your profile..."
2. Acknowledge profile: "Based on your NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation..."
3. Present the top trials: Focus on the 5 provided.
4. For each trial, highlight key matches, especially KRAS G12C.
5. Offer next steps: Ask if they want more details, more results, or to filter by location.
6. End with the disclaimer.

Keep it clear and not verbose.

Finally, end with: "This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions."

No need for another function call unless the user asks for more. This response fulfills the current query.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (SUPER SIMPLE!):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - Pass the user's query directly - it understands everything!\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list trials based on proximity to Chicago. I already called the clinical_trials tool in my previous response, and now I'm receiving the function response.

The response from the clinical_trials tool shows that it found 70 trials with sites in or near Chicago, and it's providing the top 5 matches. I need to present this information clearly, warmly, and supportively.

Key elements from the tool's response:
- Total trials: 70
- Showing top 5
- Trials listed with details like NCT ID, title, status, locations, etc.
- Importantly, for each trial, it notes if there are sites in Chicago or not. From the data:
  - NCT05398094: No Chicago sites (in Spain)
  - NCT05375994: No Chicago sites (in US but not Chicago)
  - NCT04613596: Has sites in Chicago (explicitly mentioned: "14 sites in Chicago")
  - NCT04585035: No Chicago sites
  - NCT06343402: No Chicago sites

In the locationSummary for NCT04613596, it says: "14 sites in Chicago (721 total sites)" and lists specific Illinois locations like Arlington Heights, Chicago, etc.

I need to:
- Start with a summary: "I found X trials that might be relevant..."
- Present key details: name, phase, status, brief description
- ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile (e.g., cancer type, stage, molecular markers)
- Highlight trials that target the user's mutations (KRAS G12C)
- Group by relevance, with exact matches first
- Note locations and whether they're recruiting
- Reference the conversation context

From the human's profile: NSCLC, Stage III, KRAS G12C mutation.

In presenting:
- Acknowledge the filter: Based on proximity to Chicago.
- For trials without Chicago sites, I should still mention them if they're in the top 5, but emphasize the ones that are close.
- The tool says "Found 70 trials with sites in or near Chicago," so even if not exact, they're considered proximate.

Structure my response:
1. **Introduction:** Summarize what I found, referencing the previous search.
2. **Present the trials:** List the top 5 as provided, highlighting matches.
3. **Offer next steps:** Ask if they want more details, more trials, or refinements.
4. **Disclaimer:** Remind that this is for educational purposes and to consult healthcare providers.

Finally, end by being supportive and open for more questions.

Ensure the response is not verbose: Keep it clear and concise.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (SUPER SIMPLE!):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - Pass the user's query directly - it understands everything!\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I understand you're looking for clinical trials that might match your specific type and stage of cancer.
