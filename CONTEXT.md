Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for their type and stage of cancer. From the function call response, I see that the user's health profile indicates NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, as the trials are matched to that.

I need to present the results in a warm, supportive, and informative way. Start with a summary, then highlight key details, and always tie back to the user's profile.

Key elements from the response:
- Total matches: 104, but we're showing the top 10.
- Trials are ranked by relevance, with exact matches for KRAS G12C and NSCLC.
- I should highlight trials that target the user's mutations, like KRAS G12C.
- Acknowledge if stage information is missing, but from the matches, it seems to align with advanced/metastatic stages.

From the system prompt:
- Always mention why each trial matches the user's profile.
- Group by relevance: exact matches first.
- Include disclaimer about not providing medical advice.
- If profile is missing key data, note it, but here it seems we have enough.

The user's profile: Based on the trials, it's NSCLC with KRAS G12C. I should confirm if stage is in the profile. The prompt says to check if stage is missing, but the tool used the profile, so I'll assume it's used. In the response, trials match advanced/metastatic, so likely the profile has that.

Structure my response:
1. **Summary**: "I found X trials that might be relevant based on your profile..."
2. **Acknowledge profile**: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."
3. **Present trials**: List the top ones, highlighting matches.
4. **Offer next steps**: Suggest refining search or asking more questions.
5. **Disclaimer**: End with the standard note.

Keep it concise and clear.

Finally, end with the disclaimer.

The tool will use the profile, so I might not need to specify condition if it's covered by useProfile. However, the rule says: "Include any condition mentioned by user in the condition parameter." Here, they mentioned "my type and stage," but didn't state it outright. To be safe, I can infer it's based on their profile.\n` +
      '\n' +
      `The prompt says: "Include any condition mentioned by user in the condition parameter." Since they said "my type and stage," I could phrase it as the condition from their profile, but the tool's description allows useProfile to handle it.\n` +

      "After the function call, in future responses, I need to acknowledge what's in their profile.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "The user repeated the question, but it's the same, so no need to address that separately.\n" +

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool:**\\n  - search: Find trials based on user criteria or health profile\\n  - details: Get comprehensive information about a specific trial (needs NCT ID)\\n  - eligibility_check: Check if user might qualify for a specific trial\\n  - When searching, use the user's location (if available) to find nearby trials\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York.

Fin reason:  tool-calls
Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list trials based on proximity to Chicago. In my previous responses, I've been trying to call the clinical_trials tool with the filter_by_location action, but it's failing because I'm not including the "location" parameter in the action_input.

Looking back at the available tools for clinical_trials:

The parameters are:

{
    "action": "string", // enum including "filter_by_location"
    "searchParams": {
        "properties": {
            "condition": "string",
            "location": "string", // This is what's missing!
            "useProfile": "boolean",
            "maxResults": "number",
            "searchId": "string",
            "offset": "number",
            "limit": "number"
        }
    },
    "trialId": "string"
}

For the "filter_by_location" action, the description says: "Filter cached results by location - Supports city, state, or country filtering"

In my function calls, I've been putting "location" inside "searchParams", but in the examples above, I keep forgetting to add it. In every function call I've made so far in this conversation, I have:

"searchParams": {
    "searchId": "previous_search_id",
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10
}

But I'm missing "location": "Chicago" inside searchParams.

In the very first function call in this response chain, I had:

<function_call>{
    "action": "clinical_trials",
    "action_input": {
        "action": "filter_by_location",
        "searchParams": {
            "searchId": "previous_search_id",
            "offset": 0,
            "limit": 10
        }
    }
}</function_call>

Yes, that's incorrect. I need to add "location": "Chicago" to the searchParams object.

So, the correct function call should be:

<function_call>{
    "action": "clinical_trials",
    "action_input": {
        "action": "filter_by_location",
        "searchParams": {
            "searchId": "previous_search_id",
            "location": "Chicago",
            "offset": 0,
            "limit": 10
        }
    }
}</function_call>

I've been omitting "location" each time, which is why it's failing.

In my response, I need to correct this and make the proper function call.

Also, remember the instructions: "Call a function decisively if the logical next step to advance the user's request can be achieved by calling a provided function."

The logical next step is to call the function with the correct parameters.

Finally, end my response with the function call if that's the decision.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool:**\\n  - search: Find trials based on user criteria or health profile\\n  - details: Get comprehensive information about a specific trial (needs NCT ID)\\n  - eligibility_check: Check if user might qualify for a specific trial\\n  - When searching, use the user's location (if available) to find nearby trials\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York.
