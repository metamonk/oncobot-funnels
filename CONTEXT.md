Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for KRAS in Chicago. I already called the clinical_trials tool, and now I'm receiving the response with the function output.

The response from the clinical_trials tool shows that it found 211 trials, but only 10 are being shown as the most relevant. It notes that there are no exact location matches for Chicago, which is important.

Key points from the tool's response:
- Total trials: 211
- Showing: 10 most relevant
- Location match count: 0 (so none are specifically in Chicago)
- The trials listed are for KRAS-related cancers, but locations are scattered across various states and countries.

As OncoBot, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Acknowledge the user's query and the results.
- Since the user doesn't have a health profile, the results are based on general criteria, but the tool used "useProfile": true, which might have inferred something, though the profile doesn't exist.
- Highlight any trials that match the user's potential profile, but since no profile exists, I should note that.
- Remind them that this is for educational purposes and to consult their doctor.
- Suggest next steps, like creating a profile for better personalization or refining the search.

In my previous response, I mentioned that without a profile, results might be broader. Now, with the results, I can summarize them.

Structure my response:
1. **Start with empathy and summary:** Thank them for their query and summarize what was found.
2. **Present the results:** Briefly list or summarize the top trials, focusing on relevance to KRAS.
3. **Note on location:** Point out that none of the top trials are in Chicago, and suggest how to refine.
4. **Encourage profile creation:** Since no profile exists, reiterate the benefits.
5. **End with disclaimers:** Remind them not to make decisions based on this and to consult professionals.
6. **Offer next steps:** Ask if they want more details, more results, or to create a profile.

Finally, if needed, prepare for another function call, but in this case, I can respond directly with the information.

Response guidelines:
- When presenting search results: Start with a summary, present key details, mention why they match (based on profile, which is limited).
- Since the profile isn't set up, say something like: "These trials were selected based on your query for KRAS, but without your specific health details, they might not be perfectly tailored."

Keep it concise and clear.

Creating a health profile will help me match you with trials specific to your situation.\\"\\n  - If profile is incomplete or missing key data (like stage):\\n    ‚Ä¢ Check completion status using health_profile tool with action: 'completion_status'\\n    ‚Ä¢ The tool will automatically prompt them to complete it\\n    ‚Ä¢ Mention which information is missing and how it affects results\\n  - **IMPORTANT**: Always acknowledge what specific information you're using from their profile\\n  - Example: \\"Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation...\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When stage is missing, explicitly state: \\"I notice your profile doesn't include disease stage information, which is crucial for finding the most relevant trials. Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"what trials are available for KRAS in chicago?"},{"role":"user","content":"what trials are available for KRAS in chicago?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

      "1. **NCT05327010 (ComBET Trial)**: A Phase 2 trial testing ZEN-3694 and talazoparib for advanced solid tumors, including those with KRAS mutations. It's recruiting and focuses on potentially relevant molecular markers. Locations: Various sites in California, Colorado, and other states (no Chicago sites). Match reason: Targets advanced cancers that could involve KRAS.\n" +

      '2. **NCT06015724**: A Phase 2 study combining daratumumab with a KRAS vaccine and nivolumab for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or refractory non-small cell lung cancer. Recruiting now. Locations: Washington, D.C., and New Jersey. Match reason: Directly involves KRAS-targeted therapy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. **NCT06119581**: A Phase 3 trial of olomorasib plus pembrolizumab (with or without chemotherapy) for KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. This one specifically highlights KRAS G12C, which is a common mutation. Recruiting in multiple U.S. states. Locations: Alabama, Arizona, and many others. Match reason: Strong focus on KRAS G12C mutations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. **NCT06682572**: A Phase 2 study of avutometinib plus defactinib for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, including KRAS-related cases. Recruiting in Japan. Match reason: Includes KRAS mutations as a key factor.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '5. **NCT05628038**: A Phase 2 trial combining radiotherapy, toripalimab, and chemotherapy for recurrent rectal cancer, which may involve KRAS. Recruiting in China. Match reason: Potentially relevant for KRAS in solid tumors.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '6. **NCT06555003**: A Phase 3 study comparing drug-eluting beads with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer liver metastases, often linked to KRAS. Recruiting in Iran. Match reason: Addresses KRAS-associated cancers like colorectal.\n' +

      "These trials are in various phases (mostly Phase 2 or 3) and are recruiting participants, but as I mentioned, there aren't any direct matches in Chicago based on this search.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"what trials are available for KRAS in chicago?"},{"role":"user","content":"what trials are available for KRAS in chicago?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you're asking about clinical trials for KRAS mutations in the Chicago area.

      'Having a health profile makes a big difference because it allows me to tailor trial recommendations to your specific situation, like your cancer type, stage, or other details. This helps ensure the results are as relevant and personalized as possible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "I'd love to help you get started‚Äîwould you like to create a health profile now? It's quick and secure, and it will improve our search. For now, I'll go ahead and perform a general search based on your query, but keep in mind that without your profile, the results might be broader.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "I appreciate you sharing more about your interest in clinical trials for KRAS mutations, especially in the Chicago area‚Äîit's a proactive step, and I'm here to support you through this process.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "From the search I just conducted based on your query, I found 211 clinical trials that could be relevant to KRAS mutations (like KRAS G12C, which is commonly associated with certain cancers). However, without a completed health profile, the results are more general and based on your stated interest in KRAS. That means I couldn't personalize them to factors like your specific cancer type, stage, or other details, which could make the matches even more accurate.\n" +

      "Here's a quick summary of the top 10 trials from the results. I focused on those that seem most relevant based on KRAS-related criteria, but none of these trials have sites specifically listed in Chicago. Instead, they're located in various other areas across the U.S. and internationally. I'll highlight key details for each, including why they might match your query:\n" +
      '\n' +
      "1. **NCT05327010 (ComBET Trial)**: A Phase 2 trial testing ZEN-3694 and talazoparib for advanced solid tumors, including those with KRAS mutations. It's recruiting and focuses on potentially relevant molecular markers. Locations: Various sites in California, Colorado, and other states (no Chicago sites). Match reason: Targets advanced cancers that could involve KRAS.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '2. **NCT06015724**: A Phase 2 study combining daratumumab with a KRAS vaccine and nivolumab for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or refractory non-small cell lung cancer. Recruiting now. Locations: Washington, D.C., and New Jersey. Match reason: Directly involves KRAS-targeted therapy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. **NCT06119581**: A Phase 3 trial of olomorasib plus pembrolizumab (with or without chemotherapy) for KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. This one specifically highlights KRAS G12C, which is a common mutation. Recruiting in multiple U.S. states. Locations: Alabama, Arizona, and many others. Match reason: Strong focus on KRAS G12C mutations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. **NCT06682572**: A Phase 2 study of avutometinib plus defactinib for low-grade serous ovarian cancer, including KRAS-related cases. Recruiting in Japan. Match reason: Includes KRAS mutations as a key factor.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '5. **NCT05628038**: A Phase 2 trial combining radiotherapy, toripalimab, and chemotherapy for recurrent rectal cancer, which may involve KRAS. Recruiting in China. Match reason: Potentially relevant for KRAS in solid tumors.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '6. **NCT06555003**: A Phase 3 study comparing drug-eluting beads with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer liver metastases, often linked to KRAS. Recruiting in Iran. Match reason: Addresses KRAS-associated cancers like colorectal.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '7. **NCT06072781**: A Phase 3 trial of avutometinib plus defactinib for recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer, with KRAS considerations. Recruiting in Arizona, Arkansas, and other U.S. states. Match reason: Targets KRAS in ovarian cancers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '8. **NCT06875310**: A Phase 3 study of adagrasib plus pembrolizumab and chemotherapy for KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Recruiting in Alabama, California, and many other locations. Match reason: Specifically for KRAS G12C.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '9. **NCT06447662**: A Phase 1 trial of PF-07934040 (a pan-KRAS inhibitor) alone or with other therapies for advanced solid tumors with KRAS mutations. Recruiting in Arkansas, California, and other states. Match reason: Broadly targets KRAS mutations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '10. **NCT06345729**: A Phase 3 trial of MK-1084 plus pembrolizumab for KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Recruiting in California, Florida, and other areas. Match reason: Focuses on KRAS G12C in lung cancer.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "These trials are in various phases (mostly Phase 2 or 3) and are recruiting participants, but as I mentioned, there aren't any direct matches in Chicago based on this search. This could be because trials for KRAS are often concentrated in major research hubs, and availability can change quickly.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Since you don't have a health profile yet, creating one would help me refine future searches to better align with your personal situation‚Äîlike your cancer type or stage‚Äîwhich might uncover more targeted options. Would you like to set that up now? It's straightforward and can make a real difference.\n" +
