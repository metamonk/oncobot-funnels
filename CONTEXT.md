 Let's analyze our results. Here is the @LOG1.md and here is @LOG2.md and here is @LOG3.md

My hope is that we can elucidate how well our agent is working when comparing and drawing patterns across 3 different queries.

Do you think our current patterns and architecture is too "hard coded" meaning are we trying to be performant simply by addressing this for specific cases rather than looking at the overall picture to create robust, flexible, and high-quality results?

Let's also assess whether our agent is actually using the health profile and the information that it has and is using the user information fully (when appropriate) intelligently to give us results? Is the matching and ranking actually working?

Let's analyze our results in @LOG1.md

I believe our current broad strategy is to query using general terms to get clinical trials then sort, filter, rank, etc. using the user query as well as specific health profile information.

As you can see we have an error but the clinical trials search on their website pulls up exactly the trials in @TRIALS.md and only those trials extremely quickly (any of the 'Condition/disease', 'Other terms', or 'Intervention/treatment' will work) when this whole list is pulled up.

This was working before so I don't know how we keep breakings things. I feel like we're going in circles.
Here is the user's health profile that made the queries @HEALTH_PROFILE.md to anchor your analysis.
