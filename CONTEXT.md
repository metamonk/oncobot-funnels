Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I already called the function to filter by location, and now I have the response from that function call.

The function response includes a list of trials that have been filtered for Chicago. It shows matches for several trials, with details like NCT IDs, summaries, and location information.

Key points from the response:
- There are 19 trials in total that match the filter.
- It's showing the top 5.
- Each trial has details like NCT ID, brief title, status, and locations.

As OncoBot, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Present the results clearly, starting with a summary.
- Mention why each trial matches the user's profile.
- Highlight any trials that target the user's mutations, like KRAS G12C.
- Always include the disclaimer.
- Reference the conversation context.

Structure my response:
1. **Acknowledge the request:** Thank them for specifying and confirm we're filtering based on Chicago.
2. **Summarize the results:** "I found X trials with sites in or near Chicago..."
3. **Present the trials:** List them out clearly, similar to before, with key details.
4. **Highlight relevance:** For each trial, note how it matches their profile, especially KRAS G12C.
5. **Offer next steps:** Ask if they want more details, more results, or to filter further.
6. **Disclaimer:** End with the standard reminder.

From the function response, the top trials are:
1. NCT05276726
2. NCT04613596
3. NCT06875310 (This seems to be a typo; in the response it's NCT06875310, but earlier it was NCT04956640. Wait, no, the response has NCT06875310, but in my initial search, it was different. I need to use what's in the response.)
   Actually, looking closely:
   - The response lists: NCT05276726, NCT04613596, NCT06875310, NCT06345729, NCT04303780

I should present these top 5 as per the response.

Also, in the response, it says "Showing top 5" out of 19.

Finally, ensure I don't provide medical advice.

Response format:
- Keep it concise and clear.
- Use bullet points for trials.

      "I appreciate you asking to filter the trials by proximity to Chicago—it's a great way to focus on more convenient options. Based on your previous search and using your health profile (which includes your NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation), I've filtered the results to prioritize trials with sites in or near Chicago. This helps narrow things down while still matching your specific cancer type and molecular markers.\n" +
