Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for their type and stage of cancer, so I used the clinical_trials tool as required.

The search returned no results, with a message: "No trials found matching your criteria. Try broadening your search."

In my previous response, I decided to check the health profile's completion status because the search didn't yield results, and I suspected missing data might be the issue.

Now, the function call to health_profile with action: "completion_status" has returned: {"success":true,"isCompleted":true,"message":"Health profile is complete"}

This means the profile is complete, so it should have all the necessary details like cancer type and stage.

Even though the profile is complete, no trials were found. I need to handle this gracefully.

Key guidelines:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Acknowledge what specific information I'm using from their profile.
- If the profile is complete, I should proceed based on that.
- Always remind them that this is for educational purposes and to consult their healthcare provider.
- Suggest next steps, like broadening the search or checking for updates.

Since the profile is complete, I should:
1. Inform them that the profile is complete, so we used all available info.
2. Explain the results: No trials found, which might mean none are currently available matching their exact criteria.
3. Offer to refine the search or provide alternatives, like searching without the profile or for general trials.
4. Perhaps suggest using the tool again with a broader condition or asking for more details if needed.

The rules say: "ALWAYS USE CLINICAL TRIALS TOOL for ANY health, medical, or trial-related query", so if they want to try again, I should prepare another search.

In this response, I need to wrap up this part of the conversation.

Structure my response:
- Start with empathy and recap.
- Share the profile status: It's complete, so we used that info.
- Explain the search results.
- Suggest next steps: Maybe broaden the search, or ask if they want details on how to update or search differently.
- End with the standard disclaimer.

Possible next actions:
- If they respond, I can ask for clarification or offer another search.
- Don't call another function unless it's the next logical step. Here, I've just gotten the profile status, so I should respond with that info first.

Final response should be clear and not verbose.

      '\n',
    reasoning: 'First, the user is asking about clinical trials for their type and stage of cancer. This is a health-related query, so according to my rules, I must immediately use the clinical_trials tool.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Specifically, the rule states: For ANY health, medical, or trial-related query ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY use clinical_trials tool with action: 'search' and searchParams: { useProfile: true, maxResults: 10 }.\n" +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      `The exact instruction: "Include any condition mentioned by user in the condition parameter." Here, they mentioned "my type and stage," so I could set condition to something like "user's cancer type and stage," but since the tool uses the profile, I can just let it handle it.\n` +
      '\n' +
      'In the parameters for clinical_trials, condition is a string, so I need to provide one. But the tool description says: "useProfile: true" will use the health profile, so it might pull from there.\n' +

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool:**\\n  - search: Find trials based on user criteria or health profile\\n  - details: Get comprehensive information about a specific trial (needs NCT ID)\\n  - eligibility_check: Check if user might qualify for a specific trial\\n  - When searching, use the user's location (if available) to find nearby trials\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.
