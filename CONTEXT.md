Reasoning:  I'm sorry to see that we're still encountering a technical issue when trying to access the details for NCT05920356. It looks like there might be a temporary problem with the system.

Since I can't retrieve the specific trial information right now, I can still provide some general guidance on how to check eligibility for clinical trials. This might help you in the meantime.

For educational purposes, eligibility for clinical trials like NCT05920356 typically depends on factors such as your cancer type, stage, age, prior treatments, and any specific molecular markers. Based on your health profile, which includes your NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, some trials might be a good match if they target similar profiles.

To get accurate information:
- I recommend visiting the official ClinicalTrials.gov website and searching for NCT05920356 directly.
- You can also discuss this with your healthcare provider, who can review the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria with your medical history.

If you'd like, I can explain more about how clinical trials work or help with other questions in the meantime. What would you like to do next?

Creating a health profile will help me match you with trials specific to your situation.\\"\\n  - If profile is incomplete or missing key data (like stage):\\n    ‚Ä¢ Check completion status using health_profile tool with action: 'completion_status'\\n    ‚Ä¢ The tool will automatically prompt them to complete it\\n    ‚Ä¢ Mention which information is missing and how it affects results\\n  - **IMPORTANT**: Always acknowledge what specific information you're using from their profile\\n  - Example: \\"Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation...\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When stage is missing, explicitly state: \\"I notice your profile doesn't include disease stage information, which is crucial for finding the most relevant trials. Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Do I qualify for NCT05920356"},{"role":"user","content":"Do I qualify for NCT05920356"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before I can help you determine if you might qualify for NCT05920356, I need to check your health profile.

This profile helps me provide more personalized insights based on your specific situation, like your cancer type, stage, or other details. If it's not set up, I'll guide you through creating one.\n" +

      '### General Information on Qualifying for Clinical Trials:\n' +
      '- **Eligibility Criteria**: Most trials, like NCT05920356, have specific inclusion and exclusion criteria set by the researchers. These often include factors such as your cancer type (e.g., NSCLC), stage, molecular markers (like KRAS G12C, which could make certain trials more relevant to you), prior treatments, age, overall health, and lab results. For trials targeting mutations like KRAS G12C, you might qualify if your profile matches their focus on personalized therapies.\n' +
      '  \n' +
      '- **How to Check Qualification**: \n' +
      "  - The best first step is to visit the official ClinicalTrials.gov website and search for the trial by its NCT ID (in this case, NCT05920356). There, you'll find the eligibility requirements listed.\n" +
      "  - Always consult your healthcare provider or a specialist. They can review the criteria with your full medical history and help determine if it's a good fit.\n" +
      "  - Some trials require an initial screening visit, where they'll assess your eligibility in person.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "This information is for educational purposes only and isn't a substitute for professional medical advice. Final eligibility is always decided by the trial team.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'Would you like me to:\n' +
      '- Help you search for other similar trials based on your profile?\n' +
      '- Explain more about clinical trial phases or safety?\n' +
