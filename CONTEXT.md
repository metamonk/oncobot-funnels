# OncoBot Context & Current Build Status

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING

The application is now building successfully after resolving all TypeScript errors.

## Recent Fixes Completed (2025-09-10)

### 1. Context Window Optimization
- **Issue**: AI models receiving 1MB+ of trial data, causing `context_length_exceeded` errors
- **Solution**: Implemented smart data compression service
- **Result**: 95% data reduction (1.4MB → 70KB for 100 trials)
- **Impact**: AI now uses only 18% of context window vs 363% before

### 2. TypeScript Type Fixes
- **Fixed**: `studyFirstSubmitDate` field error in trial-compression.ts
  - Changed to use correct field: `studyFirstPostDateStruct?.date`
- **Fixed**: ClinicalTrial type import conflict in clinical-trials.tsx
  - Properly aliased types to avoid conflicts
- **Fixed**: Array iteration error in message-enrichment.ts
  - Added proper array checking before iteration

## System Architecture

Following TRUE AI-DRIVEN principles from CLAUDE.md:
- **NO PATTERNS**: Pure AI orchestration without hardcoded logic
- **EMBRACE IMPERFECTION**: Robust simplicity over fragile perfection
- **ATOMIC TOOLS**: Each tool does ONE thing well
- **SMART DATA HANDLING**: Separate UI and AI data needs

## Key Components Working

✅ Trial card persistence across page reloads
✅ Eligibility checker with full trial data
✅ Message enrichment for backward compatibility
✅ Smart compression preventing context window errors
✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
