Hi Zeno,

It was such a pleasure chatting through your MVB on DetentionPay. I wanted to drop some quick feedback on your written document + our session. The ask is that you take the feedback to shape a V2 proposed solution (no need to re-submit the discovery work) by Friday end of day. If you need more time, just let me know.

Feedback:
Path to Solving the Problem: 
In our conversation, it wasn’t fully clear whether detention pay is primarily a collection issue we can solve, or whether in some cases there’s simply no recourse. You also mentioned that company drivers and owner-operators experience this differently, but the doc doesn’t clearly link those differences to the solution. If we can only solve this for a specific segment, that’s fine — but make the path from problem → who we’re solving for → solution sharper.
You noted aggregation as a key source of leverage and what we can do differently. But for an MVP, we’ll likely only have a small number of drivers or claims at first. How effective would the model be at that stage? How could you bridge that gap?
Success Metrics: We didn’t get to discuss this in the interview, but in your doc you list the key success metrics as “drivers calling us” and “repeat sellers.” Can you make this more specific?

We’re deeply appreciative of the time and effort you’ve put into this case and are excited to see your next iteration. Thanks again for engaging in the process with us!

Best,
Maria
