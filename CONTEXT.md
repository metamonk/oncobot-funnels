Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked about trials for their type and stage of cancer. From the function call response, I see that the user's health profile indicates NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, as the search results are tailored to that.

In my response, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Acknowledge the information from their profile.
- Summarize the results clearly.
- Highlight why trials match, especially the KRAS G12C mutation.
- Group trials by relevance.
- Remind them that this is not medical advice.
- Offer next steps, like asking about more details or filtering by location.

Key from the response:
- Search returned 10 trials out of 104.
- The trials are for NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation.
- Top matches are highly relevant due to exact mutation matches.
- I should mention if stage is specified; from the profile, it's used, but I need to check if it's explicitly stated. The response says "user's cancer type and stage," and the searchCriteria has "cancerType":"NSCLC", but stage isn't detailed here. In the initial instructions, I need to check if stage is missing.

In the function call, I used "condition": "user's cancer type and stage", and the tool responded with "cancerType":"NSCLC". I should verify from the profile. The tool output says "searchCriteria":{"condition":"user's cancer type and stage","useProfile":true,"cancerType":"NSCLC"} ‚Äì it doesn't specify stage in the output, so I need to address if stage is missing.

From my system prompt: "When stage is missing, explicitly state: 'I notice your profile doesn't include disease stage information...'"

In the tool response, it's not explicitly stating the stage, so I should assume it's from the profile and mention it.

Structure my response:
1. Start with a summary: "I found 10 relevant trials based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation..."
2. If stage is not confirmed, add the critical note.
3. Present the trials: Summarize key details, highlight matches.
4. End with disclaimers and offers for more info.

From the tool response, the trials are ranked by matchScore, so I'll reference that.

Finally, end with: "This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider..."

Offer follow-ups: "Would you like more details on a specific trial, or to filter by location?"

Make sure to keep it concise.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool:**\\n  - search: Find trials based on user criteria or health profile\\n  - details: Get comprehensive information about a specific trial (needs NCT ID)\\n  - eligibility_check: Check if user might qualify for a specific trial\\n  - When searching, use the user's location (if available) to find nearby trials\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

    text: "I appreciate you reaching out about clinical trials for your cancer. It's completely understandable to want to explore options that align with your specific situation, and I'm here to help guide you through this. Based on your health profile, which includes your NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation, I've searched for trials that match these details. I notice your profile includes your cancer type, but it doesn't specify the disease stage‚Äîhaving that information could help refine results even further, as it plays a key role in matching trials. If you'd like, I can assist with updating your profile for more personalized searches.\n" +

Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list trials based on proximity to Chicago. From the tool description, for the 'filter_by_location' action, the searchParams must include both 'searchId' and 'location'.

In my previous responses, I've been calling the function without the 'location' parameter, which is why it's failing. I need to fix that.

The correct function call should look like this:
<function_call>{
    "action": "clinical_trials",
    "action_input": {
        "action": "filter_by_location",
        "searchParams": {
            "searchId": "previous_search_id",
            "location": "Chicago",
            "limit": 10
        }
    }
}</function_call>

I see that in my earlier messages, I omitted "location": "Chicago" in the searchParams. That's the error.

Now, in this response, I need to make the correct function call.

Remember the rules: Always use the clinical_trials tool for health-related queries, and follow the best practices.

After this, if it succeeds, I'll get results, but since this is simulated, I need to prepare for that.

Finally, ensure my response is helpful and keeps the conversation going.

So, for this turn, I'll apologize briefly for the repeated error and then make the correct call.
