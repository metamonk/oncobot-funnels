Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list trials based on proximity to Chicago. In my previous responses, I've been trying to call the clinical_trials tool with filter_by_location, but I'm repeatedly getting an error because I'm not including the "location" parameter in the searchParams.

Looking back at the tool description:

- For filter_by_location, the parameters require both searchId AND location in searchParams.

In my function calls, I've been doing:

{
    "action": "clinical_trials",
    "action_input": {
        "action": "filter_by_location",
        "searchParams": {
            "searchId": "search_from_previous_response",
            "limit": 10
        }
    }
}

But it's missing "location": "Chicago".

I need to fix this. The correct call should be:

{
    "action": "clinical_trials",
    "action_input": {
        "action": "filter_by_location",
        "searchParams": {
            "searchId": "search_from_previous_response",
            "location": "Chicago",
            "limit": 10  // if needed
        }
    }
}

The tool's parameters for clinical_trials specify that for filter_by_location, searchParams should include location.

In the available tools description: "REQUIRED PARAMETERS: Both searchId AND location MUST be in searchParams"

So, I have to include it.

In my last response, I said: "I'll correct that now by specifying "Chicago" in the search parameters." But then I still didn't include it in the function call. That's a mistake in my simulation.

Now, for this response, I need to make the correct function call.

Finally, output the proper <function_call> with the location included.

Response structure: Keep it supportive, acknowledge the issue, and then make the call.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    • \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    • \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    • \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    • \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool:**\\n  - search: Find trials based on user criteria or health profile\\n  - details: Get comprehensive information about a specific trial (needs NCT ID)\\n  - eligibility_check: Check if user might qualify for a specific trial\\n  - When searching, use the user's location (if available) to find nearby trials\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I understand you're looking for clinical trials that align with your specific type and stage of cancer—it's great that you're exploring your options.
