      '\n' +
      '### Top 5 Relevant Trials:\n' +
      '1. **NCT04613596: Phase 2/3 Trial of Adagrasib (with Pembrolizumab)**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches your profile:** This trial is specifically for advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation, which aligns directly with your profile. It's designed for first-line treatment candidates, so it could be relevant if you're in an early treatment phase.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase and Status:** Phase 2/3, currently recruiting.  \n' +
      "   - **Key Details:** Involves adagrasib alone or combined with pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy). It's focused on improving outcomes for KRAS G12C-positive NSCLC.  \n" +
      '   - **Locations:** Available in multiple sites, including Goodyear, Prescott Valley, and Safford in Arizona, with over 700 locations across the US and internationally (e.g., Argentina, Australia, Brazil).  \n' +
      '   - **Eligibility Note:** Likely a good fit based on your mutation, but always check with your doctor for full criteria.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. **NCT04956640: Study of LY3537982 in Cancer Patients with KRAS G12C Mutation**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches your profile:** Targets KRAS G12C-mutated advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC, and is suitable for patients who haven't had prior treatment or couldn't tolerate it—making it a potential match for your situation.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase and Status:** Phase 1/2, currently recruiting.  \n' +
      '   - **Key Details:** Evaluates the drug LY3537982 (olomorasib) alone or with pembrolizumab, focusing on efficacy in KRAS G12C-positive cancers like yours.  \n' +
      '   - **Locations:** Sites in the US (e.g., Birmingham, Alabama; Los Angeles and Orange, California) and internationally (e.g., Canada, France, Japan), with about 49 total locations.  \n' +
      "   - **Eligibility Note:** This could be ideal if you're newly diagnosed or treatment-naive.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '3. **NCT06936644: Study of Fulzerasib (IBI351) with Ivonescimab for KRAS G12C NSCLC**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches your profile:** Directly targets KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC, especially for first-line treatment, which matches your profile's key markers.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase and Status:** Phase 2, not yet recruiting (you may want to monitor for updates).  \n' +
      '   - **Key Details:** Combines two drugs to treat KRAS G12C-positive lung cancer, aiming to improve outcomes in early-stage advanced disease.  \n' +
      "   - **Locations:** Not yet specified, but it's a multicenter study—I'll help check for updates if you're interested.  \n" +
      '   - **Eligibility Note:** Focused on first-line patients, so it might align well depending on your treatment history.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. **NCT06345729: Study of MK-1084 with Pembrolizumab for KRAS G12C NSCLC**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches your profile:** This trial is for advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation and no prior systemic therapy, making it a strong match for your profile's specifics.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase and Status:** Phase 3, currently recruiting.  \n' +
      '   - **Key Details:** Compares MK-1084 combined with pembrolizumab against pembrolizumab alone, targeting KRAS G12C-positive tumors to potentially enhance immunotherapy responses.  \n' +
      '   - **Locations:** Widespread in the US (e.g., Bakersfield and Beverly Hills, California; Miami Beach, Florida) and internationally (e.g., Brazil, China, Spain), with over 180 sites.  \n' +
      '   - **Eligibility Note:** Best for those without prior treatment, so it could be timely based on your history.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '5. **NCT04303780: Study of AMG 510 (Sotorasib) vs. Docetaxel for KRAS G12C NSCLC**  \n' +
      "   - **Why it matches your profile:** Specifically for KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC in previously treated patients, which could align with your profile if you've had prior therapies.  \n" +
      '   - **Phase and Status:** Phase 3, actively enrolling but not currently recruiting new participants (check for reopenings).  \n' +
      '   - **Key Details:** Compares sotorasib (a targeted therapy) to docetaxel, focusing on improving outcomes for KRAS G12C-positive lung cancer.  \n' +
      '   - **Locations:** In the US (e.g., Anaheim, Duarte, and Long Beach, California) and internationally (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Germany), with around 274 sites.  \n' +
      "   - **Eligibility Note:** Aimed at those who've had prior treatment, so it might be relevant depending on your journey.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "These trials were selected because they directly target your KRAS G12C mutation, which is a key factor in your profile, potentially offering personalized treatment options.

Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I already called the clinical_trials tool with that query, and now I'm receiving the response from that function call.

The response contains data on several trials, including their NCT IDs, details, and locations. It specifies matches based on the user's profile, like KRAS G12C mutation.

Key elements from the response:
- It's successful.
- There are matches for trials.
- Total of 26 trials found with sites in or near Chicago.
- It's showing the top 5.
- Each trial has details like NCT ID, title, status, locations, and how it matches the user's profile.

My role is to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way. I need to:
- Start with a summary.
- Present key details clearly.
- Acknowledge why each trial matches the user's profile (e.g., KRAS G12C mutation).
- Highlight locations, especially those near Chicago.
- Remind that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.

Structure my response:
1. **Summary:** Acknowledge the search and summarize what was found.
2. **Present Trials:** List the top trials based on the response, focusing on proximity to Chicago.
3. **Group by Relevance:** Since the tool already prioritized, I'll present them in the order given.
4. **Offer Next Steps:** Ask if they want more details or further refinements.
5. **End with Disclaimer:** Standard reminder.

Specifics from the response:
- Trials listed: NCT05276726, NCT04613596, NCT04303780, NCT06345729, NCT06875310
- For each, note the match score, why it matches, and locations near Chicago.

Reference the user's profile: NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, and mention that stage is missing if relevant.

Finally, keep it concise and conversational.

Response Outline:
- Intro: "Based on your request, I've filtered the trials to those near Chicago, using your profile for relevance."
- Summary: "I found 26 trials with sites in or near Chicago, and here are the top 5 that best match your profile."
- List the trials with key details.
- Close: Offer help and disclaimer.
