Reasoning:  First, the function call to clinical_trials returned a response. Let's look at what it says:

- "success": true

- "matches": []  (This means no trials were found)

- "totalCount": 0  (Zero trials match the query)

This is disappointing, but I need to handle it compassionately and helpfully. I should not leave the user empty-handed.

Key elements from the response:

- It's using the user's health profile, which includes NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation.

- The query was for KRAS G12C trials in Chicago.

- The tool applied the profile and location, but still found no matches.

My role is to:

- Be warm and supportive.

- Guide the user through their journey.

- Suggest next steps, like broadening the search or checking for updates.

- Remind them that this doesn't mean no trials exist; databases might not be up-to-date.

- Offer to refine the search or provide educational info.

Since no trials were found, I should:

1. Acknowledge the result gently.

2. Explain possible reasons (e.g., no active trials in that area right now).

3. Suggest alternatives, like searching in nearby areas or for related mutations.

4. Offer to use the clinical_trials_info tool if they have questions about trials in general.

5. Encourage them to consult their healthcare provider.

Finally, end by asking if they'd like to try a different search or learn more.

Structure my response:

- Start with empathy: "I'm sorry we didn't find any matches right now..."

- Summarize what was searched: Based on your KRAS G12C mutation and Chicago location, using your profile.

- Provide options: Search in a broader area, or get general info.

- Include the standard disclaimer.

No need for another function call unless I decide to, but based on this, I should respond directly first.

Creating a health profile will help me match you with trials specific to your situation.\\"\\n  - If profile is incomplete or missing key data (like stage):\\n    ‚Ä¢ Check completion status using health_profile tool with action: 'completion_status'\\n    ‚Ä¢ The tool will automatically prompt them to complete it\\n    ‚Ä¢ Mention which information is missing and how it affects results\\n  - **IMPORTANT**: Always acknowledge what specific information you're using from their profile\\n  - Example: \\"Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation...\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When stage is missing, explicitly state: \\"I notice your profile doesn't include disease stage information, which is crucial for finding the most relevant trials. Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you're asking about clinical trials related to KRAS G12C mutations, specifically in the Chicago area.

      "I'm sorry to share that my search for clinical trials related to KRAS G12C mutations in the Chicago area didn't turn up any matches at the moment. That's disappointing, and I know how frustrating this can feel when you're exploring options. Let me explain a bit more based on what I just checked.\n" +

      'To help you move forward, here are a few supportive suggestions:\n' +
      '- **Broaden the search**: We could expand to nearby cities or a larger radius, like the Midwest region, to see if there are trials a bit farther away. Would you like me to try that?\n' +
      "- **Check for updates**: Trial information is updated regularly, so it's worth revisiting this in a few weeks or checking with your healthcare team for the latest details.\n" +
