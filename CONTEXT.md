Warnings:  []
Fin reason:  tool-calls
Reasoning:  First, the user is asking about clinical trials for their type and stage of cancer. This is a health-related query, so according to my rules, I must immediately use the clinical_trials tool.

Specifically, the rule states: For ANY health, medical, or trial-related query → IMMEDIATELY use clinical_trials tool with action: 'search' and searchParams: { useProfile: true, maxResults: 10 }.

I need to include any condition mentioned by the user in the condition parameter. The user says "my type and stage of cancer," which implies using their health profile, where this information is stored.

From the system prompt: "The tool automatically handles missing profiles and always returns helpful results." So, I can proceed with useProfile: true.

In searchParams, I should set condition to something relevant. The user didn't specify the exact type and stage in this message, but it's referring to their profile. I can infer that from their profile.

The prompt says: "Include any condition mentioned by user in the condition parameter." Here, they mentioned "my type and stage," so I might set condition to a string that represents that, but since it's based on their profile, I'll let useProfile handle it.

Best practice: Use action: 'search' with searchParams: { useProfile: true, maxResults: 10 }. If there's a specific condition, add it, but in this case, it's tied to their profile.

I need to acknowledge what specific information I'm using from their profile in my response after the tool call.

Also, if the profile is missing key data like stage, I need to explicitly state that.

Since I'm calling the tool, I'll do that in my response based on what the tool returns.

Structure my response: First, make the function call, then in subsequent interactions, present the results.

My response should end with the function call if that's the next step.

Finally, remember to be warm and supportive.

So, my immediate action: Output a function call for clinical_trials with the appropriate parameters.

Parameters for clinical_trials:

- action: "search"

- searchParams: {

  "condition": "The user's type and stage of cancer" – but wait, I need to be specific. The user didn't state it explicitly, so I'll omit it or use a general term? No, the prompt says: "Include any condition mentioned by user" – they mentioned "my type and stage," but that's not a string like "lung cancer." Since we're using the profile, I can just set useProfile: true and not specify condition if it's not directly given.

Looking at the tool description: "condition": "The condition or query to search for" – I can set it to something like "user's cancer" or leave it out, but to be precise, perhaps set it to null or based on profile.

In the examples, for "Find trials for lung cancer", it uses condition: "lung cancer". Here, since it's "my type and stage", I'll assume the tool will use the profile.

To follow the rule: "Include any condition mentioned" – I could set condition to "cancer based on user's profile" or something, but that's not standard. Actually, the tool allows it to be a string, so perhaps I don't need to if useProfile is true.

The system prompt says: "The tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true", so I think it's fine.

I'll go with:

<function_call>

{

  "action": "clinical_trials",

  "action_input": {

    "action": "search",

    "searchParams": {

      "useProfile": true,

      "maxResults": 10

    }

  }

}

</function_call>

That matches the required format.

After this call, in the next response, I'll present the results, acknowledging the profile details.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    • \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    • \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    • \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    • \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool:**\\n  - search: Find trials based on user criteria or health profile\\n  - details: Get comprehensive information about a specific trial (needs NCT ID)\\n  - eligibility_check: Check if user might qualify for a specific trial\\n  - When searching, use the user's location (if available) to find nearby trials\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.
