Reasoning:  First, the user asked to "show the next 4," which is a follow-up to the previous search. I've just received the function call results from the clinical_trials tool, which returned 4 trials (trials 6-9 out of 40 total).

I need to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way, just like in my previous responses. Structure it similarly:

- Start with a summary.

- List the trials with key details.

- Explain why they match the user's profile.

- Remind them that this is for educational purposes and to consult their doctor.

From the function response:

- Total trials found in this call: 4

- They are: NCT06026410, NCT06497556, NCT05609578, NCT04613596

- Each has details like title, summary, conditions, interventions, locations, etc.

- All have a relevanceScore of 0.95 and match the user's profile (NSCLC, KRAS G12C, etc.).

- Some locations are in Chicago, which is perfect for the user's query.

Key points from the response:

- NCT06026410: Involves NSCLC, locations not directly in Chicago but nearby.

- NCT06497556: Has sites in Chicago (e.g., Rush University Medical Center).

- NCT05609578: Has sites in Chicago (e.g., University of Chicago).

- NCT04613596: Has sites in Chicago (e.g., University of Chicago).

I should highlight matches to the user's profile, especially the KRAS G12C mutation.

End by offering next steps, like asking if they want more details or more trials.

Finally, include the standard disclaimer.

Structure my response:

1. Acknowledge the user's request.

2. Summarize what I found.

3. List the next 4 trials with key details.

4. Offer to provide more information or continue.

Since the function response says "Showing results 6-9 of 40 trials" and "hasMore": true, I can mention that there are more available.
