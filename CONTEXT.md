Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?" I've already called the clinical_trials tool, and now I'm receiving the response. The response shows that the tool found 102 trials, with 10 most relevant ones listed.

From the user's health profile, I know it includes details like NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) and KRAS G12C mutation, as highlighted in the matches.

My response needs to be:
- Warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Acknowledge the information from their profile.
- Summarize the results clearly.
- Highlight key details like why trials match (e.g., KRAS G12C).
- Remind them that this is not medical advice.
- Offer next steps, like asking for more details or refining the search.

Key elements from the tool response:
- Total trials: 102
- Showing 10 most relevant.
- Matches based on KRAS G12C mutation and cancer type (NSCLC).
- Some trials are recruiting, others not.
- Locations are various, but none specifically targeted.

I need to:
- Start with a summary: "I found X trials..."
- Present key details: Name, phase, status, brief description.
- Group by relevance: Exact matches first.
- Mention eligibility indicators.
- Note locations and recruiting status.
- Since the profile includes KRAS G12C, highlight those trials.
- If stage is missing, I should check, but from the context, it seems the profile has it, as the tool used it.

In the initial setup, I need to check if stage is in the profile. The tool response says it matched based on type and stage, so I'll assume it's there. But per instructions: "When stage is missing, explicitly state..." The response doesn't specify, but the search criteria in the tool output is "condition":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?" and "useProfile":true, so it's using whatever is in the profile.

In my previous message, I didn't check the profile explicitly, but the tool did. To be thorough, I should acknowledge what's in the profile.

Structure my response:
1. Acknowledge the search and profile: "Based on your health profile, which includes your NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation..."
2. Summarize: "I found 102 trials that might be relevant, with 10 shown here as the most matching."
3. Present trials: Briefly list or summarize the top ones, highlighting matches.
4. End with disclaimers and offers for more help.

Keep it concise, as per instructions: "Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!"

Finally, if needed, suggest next steps like asking about specific trials or locations.

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (SUPER SIMPLE!):**\\n  - Just ONE action: 'search'\\n  - Pass the user's query directly - it understands everything!\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { action: \\"search\\", query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting Results:\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there any trials for my type and stage of cancer?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I called the clinical_trials tool with the query "Could you list them based on proximity to Chicago?" and provided parsedIntent.

The tool responded with a list of trials, indicating it found 70 trials with sites in or near Chicago, and it's showing the top 10.

In my response, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Summarize the results clearly.
- Reference the user's profile where relevant.
- Highlight matches to their cancer type, stage, and mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C).
- Group or present trials by relevance, starting with the most relevant.
- Mention why each trial matches.
- Include the standard disclaimer.

From the tool's response:
- There are 70 total trials, but only the top 10 are shown.
- Trials include ones like NCT05375994, which matches KRAS G12C NSCLC.
- Some have sites in Chicago, others don't, but the tool filtered for proximity.

Key points from the response:
- Trials are listed with details like NCT ID, title, status, and locations.
- For example, NCT04199689 has sites in Chicago.
- I need to present this in a user-friendly way, not just dump the raw data.

Structure my response:
1. **Start with a summary:** Acknowledge the search and what was found.
   - "Based on your request, I refined the search for trials near Chicago, using your health profile for NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation."
2. **Present the trials:** Summarize the top ones, focusing on relevance.
   - List the top 5 or so to keep it concise.
   - For each, include: NCT ID, brief title, phase, status, why it matches, and key locations.
   - Highlight if it targets KRAS G12C.
3. **Note on proximity:** Mention that these are sorted by proximity.
4. **Offer next steps:** Ask if they want more details or further refinements.
5. **Disclaimer:** End with the standard reminder.

Since the tool returned 70 results but only showed 10, I should mention that and offer to show more if needed.

Finally, ensure the response is not verbose‚Äîkeep it clear and focused.

Locations include San Francisco, CA; Aurora, CO; and others.  \\n   - **Eligibility indicators:** Likely eligible based on your mutation and cancer type.\\n\\n2. **NCT05398094 (Sotorasib for Unresectable Stage III NSCLC with KRAS G12C)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 2  \\n   - **Status:** Recruiting  \\n   - **Brief Description:** Induction therapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC with KRAS mutations.  \\n   - **Why it matches your profile:** Matches your KRAS G12C mutation, NSCLC type, and stage. Sites are in Spain (e.g., Badalona, Barcelona).  \\n\\n3. **NCT06447662 (PF-07934040 for Advanced Solid Tumors with KRAS Mutations)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 1  \\n   - **Status:** Recruiting  \\n   - **Brief Description:** Targets KRAS-mutated tumors, including NSCLC, with potential combination therapies.  \\n   - **Why it matches your profile:** Specifically aligns with your KRAS G12C mutation and NSCLC. Locations include Fayetteville, AR; Duarte, CA; and more.  \\n\\n4. **NCT05009329 (JAB-21822 for KRAS G12C Solid Tumors)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 1/2  \\n   - **Status:** Actively recruiting (not yet at all sites)  \\n   - **Brief Description:** Evaluates a KRAS inhibitor for advanced solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutations.  \\n   - **Why it matches your profile:** Strong match for your KRAS G12C mutation and NSCLC. Available in Beijing, China.  \\n\\n5. **NCT06946927 (JMKX001899 for KRAS G12C NSCLC)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 1  \\n   - **Status:** Recruiting  \\n   - **Brief Description:** Combines therapies for advanced KRAS G12C NSCLC.  \\n   - **Why it matches your profile:** Targets your KRAS G12C mutation and NSCLC exactly. Located in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\\n\\nThese trials were prioritized because they directly align with your KRAS G12C mutation and NSCLC details from your profile. Remember, while this information is based on available data, final eligibility is determined by the trial teams, and I notice your profile doesn't explicitly confirm disease stage in this response‚Äîit's crucial for even more precise matches, so consider updating it if needed.\\n\\nThis is `... 7148 more characters
