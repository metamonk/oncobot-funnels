Reasoning:  First, the user said "show me the last 6", and I already called the function for that. Now, I've received the response from the clinical_trials tool. It contains data for the last 6 trials (results 11-16 out of 16).

I need to process this response and present it to the user in a clear, supportive, and informative way, just like in previous responses.

Key elements from the tool response:
- Total trials: 16
- We're showing results 11-16
- Trials listed: NCT04613596, NCT05853575, NCT05920356 (and possibly more, but the response shows three in detail; wait, actually, the response has three detailed entries, but the metadata says totalCount:16 and we're showing 11-16, so I need to assume these are the ones provided).

The function response has a "matches" array with three items, but the message says "Showing results 11-16 of 16 trials", and pagination confirms offset:10, limit:6, total:16, showing:11-16. However, only three are detailed in the response. I should work with what's provided and present it accurately.

In my response, I need to:
- Start with a warm, supportive summary.
- Reference the user's health profile and the ongoing search.
- Present the trials clearly, with key details.
- Highlight why they match the user's profile.
- End with an offer for more help.

Structure the response:
1. Acknowledge the request: "I've got the last set of trials for you..."
2. Summarize: "Based on your query, here are the final 6 trials..."
3. Present the trials: Use the same format as before – numbered list with title, why it matches, key details, locations, eligibility snapshot.
4. Since the tool response has only three detailed matches, but claims to show 6, I'll list the ones provided and note if there are any discrepancies. But in the response, it says "matches" array has three items, so perhaps that's all that's returned. I'll proceed with what's there.
5. Remind them this is for informational purposes.
6. Ask if they need more assistance.

Finally, ensure I include the standard disclaimer.

Output the response in a conversational, helpful manner.

      '   - **Why it matches your profile**: This trial targets advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations, like your Stage IV diagnosis, and includes options for patients with similar characteristics.  \n' +
      '   - **Key details**: Phase 2/3, actively recruiting, with an enrollment of 806 participants. It evaluates adagrasib alone or combined with pembrolizumab.  \n' +
      '   - **Locations**: Sites in Chicago, Illinois (e.g., University of Chicago, recruiting), which is right in your area, along with others in states like Arizona and California.  \n' +
      '   - **Eligibility snapshot**: Possible match (eligibility score: 0.58, medium confidence), based on your KRAS G12C mutation and advanced disease, though some details like PD-L1 status might need verification.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. **NCT05853575: Trial of Two Adagrasib Dosing Regimens in NSCLC With KRAS G12C Mutation (KRYSTAL 21)**  \n' +
      '   - **Why it matches your profile**: It focuses on advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations, directly relevant to your situation, and explores treatment options for metastatic cases.  \n' +
      '   - **Key details**: Phase 2, actively recruiting, with up to 200 participants. This study compares different dosing regimens of adagrasib.  \n' +
      '   - **Locations**: A site in Chicago, Illinois (status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING), with other options in states like California and Missouri.  \n' +
      '   - **Eligibility snapshot**: Possible match (eligibility score: 0.65, high confidence), given your KRAS G12C status and prior treatment history, but prior therapies targeting KRAS could be an exclusion.\n' +

      '3. **NCT05920356: A Study Evaluating Sotorasib Platinum Doublet Combination Versus Pembrolizumab Platinum Doublet Combination as a Front-Line Therapy in Participants With Stage IV or Advanced Stage IIIB/C Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (CodeBreaK 202)**  \n' +
      '   - **Why it matches your profile**: Tailored for Stage IV NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations, this aligns well with your diagnosis and could offer front-line therapy options.  \n' +
      '   - **Key details**: Phase 3, actively recruiting, with up to 750 participants. It compares sotorasib combinations to other treatments.  \n' +
      '   - **Locations**: Sites in Chicago, Illinois (e.g., University of Illinois Chicago, recruiting), making it convenient, plus locations in states like California and Delaware.  \n' +

      `4. Since the tool response has only three detailed matches, but claims to show 6, I'll list the ones provided and note if there are any discrepancies. But in the response, it says "matches" array has three items, so perhaps that's all that's returned. I'll proceed with what's there.\n` +
