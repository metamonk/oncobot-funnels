# Context - Current Status

## ✅ BUILD FIXED - Application Status
- **Production build successful** - All pages building correctly
- Development server running successfully
- Vercel Analytics integrated comprehensively
- Contact form working with dual integration (Resend + GoHighLevel)
- Analytics dashboard tracking implemented

## Solution Applied: Suspense Boundaries (Next.js 15 Best Practice)

### The Problem
Next.js 15 requires components that use `useSearchParams()` or access browser APIs during static generation to be wrapped in Suspense boundaries. Our `useFunnelAnalytics` hook calls `getUTMParams()` which accesses `window.location.search`, causing build failures.

### The Correct Solution (Following Next.js 15 Best Practices)
Instead of using `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (which forces entire pages to be dynamic), we implemented the proper pattern:

1. **Separate the content component** from the main export
2. **Wrap content in Suspense boundary** to handle async operations
3. **Maintain static generation** for better performance

### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
'use client';

import { Suspense } from 'react';
// ... other imports

function PageNameContent() {
  // Component that uses useFunnelAnalytics or useSearchParams
  const { track } = useFunnelAnalytics();
  // ... component logic
  return <div>...</div>;
}

// Main export wrapped in Suspense
export default function PageName() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={null}>
      <PageNameContent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### Pages Fixed with Suspense Boundaries
✅ `/contact`
✅ `/membership/booking`
✅ `/membership/thank-you`
✅ `/membership`
✅ `/eligibility/[indication]`
✅ `/eligibility/[indication]/quiz`
✅ `/eligibility/[indication]/monitoring-confirmation`

### Why This is the Correct Approach
1. **Performance**: Allows static generation of most content
2. **SEO**: Better for search engines with pre-rendered content
3. **User Experience**: Faster initial page loads
4. **Best Practice**: Follows Next.js 15 recommendations
5. **Minimal Impact**: Only the dynamic parts are client-rendered

## Build Output
