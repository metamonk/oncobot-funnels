What's Left To Do:

Based on our implementation and the documentation, here's what remains:

1. Verify Analytics Implementation is Working

- Test that events are being sent to both Plausible and PostHog
- Verify health profile funnel tracking is capturing all steps
- Check that clinical trials interactions are being tracked properly

2. Configure Analytics Dashboards

- Set up Plausible goals for key conversions
- Configure PostHog funnels for health profile completion
- Create dashboards for monitoring key metrics

3. Minor Documentation Updates Needed

The privacy doc could benefit from small updates:
- Add mention of the Web Vitals Tracker component we created
- Update the "Last Updated" date if we make changes
- Consider adding specific event names for transparency

4. Testing & Validation

- Run the test-posthog-integration.ts script to verify PostHog is working
- Test that Do Not Track is being respected
- Verify that sensitive health data is being masked properly

5. Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Implement session recording with proper masking (currently disabled)
- Add A/B testing capabilities
- Create user cohorts for better insights
- Add retention tracking for returning users
