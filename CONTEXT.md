      '### Quick Overview of the Trial:\n' +
      '- **Trial Name:** A Study Evaluating Sotorasib Platinum Doublet Combination Versus Pembrolizumab Platinum Doublet Combination (CodeBreaK 202)\n' +
      '- **NCT ID:** NCT05920356\n' +
      '- **Phase:** Phase 3\n' +
      '- **Status:** Recruiting\n' +
      '- **Focus:** This trial is testing sotorasib combined with chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC in patients with a KRAS p.G12C mutation who are PD-L1 negative.\n' +
      "- **Key Details:** It's aimed at people with stage IV or advanced stage IIIB/C NSCLC, and the primary goals are to compare progression-free survival and overall survival.\n" +
      "- **Locations:** The trial has sites across multiple countries, including the United States, Argentina, Australia, and many others. For example, in the US, sites include places like the University of Illinois Chicago and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. I can help you look into specific locations if you'd like.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '### How This Might Relate to Your Profile:\n' +
      "From what I see in your health profile (which notes your NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation), this trial could be relevant because it specifically targets KRAS p.G12C mutations, which matches your details. Here's a high-level look at the main eligibility criteria based on the trial information:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '- **Inclusion Criteria (Potential Matches):**\n' +
      '  - You must have a confirmed diagnosis of nonsquamous NSCLC with a KRAS p.G12C mutation and be PD-L1 negative. Since your profile mentions KRAS G12C, this is a strong potential match, but PD-L1 status would need to be verified.\n' +
      '  - No prior systemic therapy for metastatic or advanced disease.\n' +
      "  - Good performance status (e.g., ECOG ‚â§ 1, meaning you're able to carry out daily activities without significant assistance).\n" +
      '\n' +
      '- **Exclusion Criteria (Things to Consider):**\n' +
      '  - If your cancer has mixed histology (like small-cell components) or other treatable molecular alterations, you might not qualify.\n' +
      '  - Symptomatic brain metastases, certain gastrointestinal issues, or a history of heart problems could exclude you.\n' +
      '  - Prior treatment with a KRAS G12C inhibitor might make you ineligible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This trial highlights KRAS G12C prominently, which aligns with your profile, making it worth exploring further. However, factors like your exact stage, PD-L1 status, and overall health would play a big role in determining fit.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "If you'd like, I can help with next steps‚Äîsuch as searching for nearby locations, providing contact details for the trial sites, or even checking if there are other trials that might suit your situation better. Just let me know how I can assist, or if you have any questions about this. Remember, this information is for educational purposes only, and always consult your healthcare provider before pursuing any clinical trial. You're taking important steps, and I'm here to support you through this.",

      "Based on your query about NCT05920356, I'll look up the trial details and see how they might align with your profile.

      "Thank you for your patience while I pulled up the details for NCT05920356. Based on your health profile, which indicates you have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a KRAS G12C mutation, I can help you understand how this trial might align with its eligibility criteria. However, please remember that I can't determine your eligibility or provide any medical advice‚Äîonly the trial team can do that after a thorough review. This is just for informational purposes, and I strongly recommend discussing this with your healthcare provider to get personalized guidance.\n" +

      '### Quick Overview of the Trial:\n' +
      '- **Trial Name:** A Study Evaluating Sotorasib Platinum Doublet Combination Versus Pembrolizumab Platinum Doublet Combination (CodeBreaK 202)\n' +
      '- **NCT ID:** NCT05920356\n' +
      '- **Phase:** Phase 3\n' +
      '- **Status:** Recruiting\n' +
      '- **Focus:** This trial is testing sotorasib combined with chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC in patients with a KRAS p.G12C mutation who are PD-L1 negative.\n' +
      "- **Key Details:** It's aimed at people with stage IV or advanced stage IIIB/C NSCLC, and the primary goals are to compare progression-free survival and overall survival.\n" +
      "- **Locations:** The trial has sites across multiple countries, including the United States, Argentina, Australia, and many others. For example, in the US, sites include places like the University of Illinois Chicago and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. I can help you look into specific locations if you'd like.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '### How This Might Relate to Your Profile:\n' +
      "From what I see in your health profile (which notes your NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation), this trial could be relevant because it specifically targets KRAS p.G12C mutations, which matches your details. Here's a high-level look at the main eligibility criteria based on the trial information:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '- **Inclusion Criteria (Potential Matches):**\n' +
      '  - You must have a confirmed diagnosis of nonsquamous NSCLC with a KRAS p.G12C mutation and be PD-L1 negative. Since your profile mentions KRAS G12C, this is a strong potential match, but PD-L1 status would need to be verified.\n' +
      '  - No prior systemic therapy for metastatic or advanced disease.\n' +
      "  - Good performance status (e.g., ECOG ‚â§ 1, meaning you're able to carry out daily activities without significant assistance).\n" +
      '\n' +
      '- **Exclusion Criteria (Things to Consider):**\n' +
      '  - If your cancer has mixed histology (like small-cell components) or other treatable molecular alterations, you might not qualify.\n' +
      '  - Symptomatic brain metastases, certain gastrointestinal issues, or a history of heart problems could exclude you.\n' +
      '  - Prior treatment with a KRAS G12C inhibitor might make you ineligible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This trial highlights KRAS G12C prominently, which aligns with your profile, making it worth exploring further. However, factors like your exact stage, PD-L1 status, and overall health would play a big role in determining fit.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "If you'd like, I can help with next steps‚Äîsuch as searching for nearby locations, providing contact details for the trial sites, or even checking if there are other trials that might suit your situation better. Just let me know how I can assist, or if you have any questions about this. Remember, this information is for educational purposes only, and always consult your healthcare provider before pursuing any clinical trial. You're taking important steps, and I'm here to support you through this."
