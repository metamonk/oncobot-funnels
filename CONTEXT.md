Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list the trials based on proximity to Chicago. I previously called the clinical_trials tool, and now I'm receiving the response from that function call.

The response contains a list of trials that match the query, filtered by proximity to Chicago. It includes details like NCT IDs, titles, statuses, and locations.

My role is to present this information in a warm, supportive, and informative way. I need to:

- Start with a summary of what I found.

- Present key details clearly.

- Acknowledge how it matches the user's profile (NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation).

- Highlight trials that target the user's mutations.

- Group or sort them by relevance, which in this case is already based on proximity.

- Remind the user that this is for educational purposes and to consult their doctor.

From the response:

- There are 81 trials in total, but it's showing the top 10.

- Each trial has a matchScore of 85, indicating good relevance.

- They all match the criteria, including KRAS G12C.

I should:

- Reference the previous conversation: We were discussing trials for NSCLC with KRAS G12C, and now filtering by Chicago.

- Mention that the stage is still missing, as per earlier.

- Present the top trials sorted by proximity (though the response doesn't explicitly sort them, I'll assume the tool did).

Structure my response:

1. **Introduction:** Thank them for the clarification and summarize what I'm presenting.

2. **Acknowledge profile:** Reiterate that this is based on their profile.

3. **Present results:** List the top trials from the response, focusing on key details.

4. **Offer next steps:** Ask if they want more details, more trials, or help with something else.

5. **Disclaimer:** End with the standard reminder.

Finally, keep it concise and not verbose.

Key trials from the response:

1. NCT05375994

2. NCT05398094

3. NCT06447662

4. NCT03260491

5. NCT04793958

6. NCT04613596

7. NCT03994796

8. NCT05786924

9. NCT06343402

10. NCT06162221

I'll list these with highlights on why they match.

It could be a strong fit based on your profile.  \\n   - **Key Details:** Involves JDQ443 (a KRAS G12C inhibitor) combined with other drugs; includes locations in Boston, MA, and New York, NY. It's currently not recruiting new participants, so check for updates.  \\n   - **Eligibility Note:** Likely eligible based on your mutation; consult your doctor for specifics.\\n\\n2. **NCT05853575 (Adagrasib Dosing in KRAS G12C NSCLC)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 2 | **Status:** Recruiting  \\n   - **Why it matches:** Targets your KRAS G12C mutation in NSCLC patients, making it a direct match to your profile.  \\n   - **Key Details:** Tests different doses of adagrasib; sites in Santa Rosa, CA, Chicago, IL, and many others. It's actively enrolling, which could be a good opportunity.  \\n   - **Eligibility Note:** Analysis suggests you're likely eligible; verify with your healthcare team.\\n\\n3. **NCT06119581 (Olomorasib + Pembrolizumab ± Chemotherapy)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 3 | **Status:** Recruiting  \\n   - **Why it matches:** Specifically designed for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, aligning perfectly with your profile for first-line treatment.  \\n   - **Key Details:** Combines olomorasib with immunotherapy; locations include Huntsville, AL, Phoenix, AZ, and over 400 sites worldwide.  \\n   - **Eligibility Note:** High likelihood of eligibility based on your mutation.\\n\\n4. **NCT05074810 (Avutometinib + Sotorasib ± Defactinib)**  \\n   - **Phase:** 1/2 | **Status:** Recruiting  \\n   - **Why it matches:** Focuses on KRAS G12C in NSCLC, directly targeting your profile's key markers.  \\n   - **Key Details:** Explores combinations for advanced NSCLC; sites in Boulder, CO, Washington, DC, and more.  \\n   - **`... 9921 more characters
