Reasoning:  First, the user queried about "kras g12c trials chicago," and I've just received the results from the clinical_trials function call. It returned 5 trials out of 41 total matches, all relevant to NSCLC and KRAS G12C, which aligns with the user's health profile.

My response needs to be warm, supportive, and conversational. I should summarize the results, highlight key details, and explain why they match the user's profile. Remember to emphasize that this is for informational purposes only and not medical advice.

Key elements from the results:
- Total trials: 41
- Showing: 5 (NCT03260491, NCT03785249, NCT06162221, NCT06026410, NCT06119581)
- All are recruiting and match the user's NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation.
- Some have locations in or near Chicago, like NCT03785249 and NCT06119581 which have facilities in Chicago.

Structure my response:
1. **Start with a summary:** Acknowledge what I found and how it relates to the user.
2. **Present the trials:** Briefly list the top 5, focusing on:
   - NCT ID
   - Title
   - Phase
   - Status
   - Key locations (especially near Chicago)
   - Why it matches (e.g., targets KRAS G12C, matches NSCLC)
3. **Highlight relevance:** Since the user's profile includes KRAS G12C and NSCLC, point that out.
4. **Offer next steps:** Ask if they want more details, more results, or help with something else.
5. **Reminders:** Include the standard disclaimer about not providing medical advice and consulting healthcare providers.
6. **Keep it concise:** Avoid verbosity.

Since there are more results (41 total), I should mention that and offer to show more.

Finally, end by being supportive and open for follow-up questions.

Response outline:
- Warm intro: "I'm glad to share that I found some promising trials..."
- Summary: "Based on your profile and location, here are the top 5 trials..."
- List trials briefly.
- Closing: "Remember, this is just information... Would you like more details?"

The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I see you're asking about clinical trials for KRAS G12C mutations, specifically those near Chicago.
