Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "Are there trials for KRAS G12C in Chicago?" This is a query about specific clinical trials, so I need to use the **clinical_trials** tool, not clinical_trials_info, as it's for searching specific trials.

I already checked the health profile earlier in the conversation, and it confirmed that the user has a complete profile. So, I can proceed with the search using that context.

From the function call response, I have a list of trials that match the query. I need to present this information clearly, summarizing the key details, and highlighting how they relate to the user's profile.

Key elements from the system prompt:
- **Presenting SEARCH Results**: Start with a summary like "I found X trials that might be relevant..." and present key details: name, phase, status, brief description. ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile (e.g., cancer type, stage, molecular markers).
- Acknowledge specific information from their profile, like KRAS G12C mutation.
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- End with a reminder that this is for educational purposes and they should consult their healthcare provider.
- If trials target the user's mutations, highlight that prominently.

From the response:
- There are multiple trials listed, such as NCT03608631, NCT04449874, etc.
- Many are relevant due to KRAS mutations, which matches the user's profile.
- I need to summarize without overwhelming; perhaps highlight the top few that are most relevant, especially those near Chicago or targeting KRAS G12C.

The user's profile includes NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, based on earlier context. So, prioritize trials for lung cancer or those matching this.

Structure my response:
1. **Summary**: Start with "Based on your health profile, which includes your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation, I've found several trials that might be relevant for KRAS G12C mutations near Chicago."
2. **Key Trials**: List 3-5 top trials, including:
   - NCT ID
   - Title
   - Phase and status
   - Brief summary
   - Why it matches (e.g., targets KRAS G12C, location)
   - If in Chicago or nearby.
3. **Next Steps**: Offer to provide more details or help with follow-up questions.
4. **Disclaimer**: Remind them not to make decisions based on this alone.

Finally, keep it concise and not verbose.

Response Plan:
- Acknowledge the search results.
- Summarize findings.
- List relevant trials briefly.
- End with support and disclaimer.

Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there trials for KRAS G12C in Chicago?"},{"role":"user","content":"Are there trials for KRAS G12C in Chicago?"}],"tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_search","description":"Search the web for information with 5-10 queries, max results and search depth.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"queries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","description":"Array of search queries to look up on the web.

It's recruiting and emphasizes personalized targeting based on mutations.\n" +

      "Great news—I've confirmed that you have a complete health profile, which means I can use that information to provide more personalized trial matches. Based on your profile (which includes details like your cancer type, stage, and any relevant molecular markers), I'll search for clinical trials targeting KRAS G12C mutations near Chicago.\n" +

      'Let me run that search for you now.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'I appreciate your patience while I pulled up the details on clinical trials for KRAS G12C mutations, especially near Chicago. Based on your health profile, which includes your NSCLC diagnosis and KRAS G12C mutation, I was able to refine the search to focus on trials that might align with your situation. This helps ensure the results are as personalized as possible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "From the search, I found several trials that could be relevant, including some with locations in or near Chicago. Here's a quick summary of the most promising ones based on your profile:\n" +
      '\n' +
      "- **NCT04449874**: This Phase 1 trial is testing GDC-6036 (a KRAS G12C-targeted therapy) alone or in combination for advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC. It matches your KRAS G12C mutation and has sites recruiting in the U.S., including one in Chicago (University of Chicago). It's actively recruiting, with a focus on safety and early efficacy.\n" +
      '  \n' +
      "- **NCT06625320**: A Phase 3 study evaluating daraxonrasib for metastatic pancreatic cancer, but it's relevant due to its inclusion of KRAS mutations and has a site at the University of Chicago. This one highlights trials for advanced disease, which could align with your profile if there's overlap in your history.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "- **NCT05585320**: This Phase 1/2 trial is looking at IMM-1-104 for advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC with RAS mutations like KRAS G12C. It has sites in the U.S., and while not directly in Chicago, there are nearby locations (e.g., Northwestern University in Chicago). It's recruiting and emphasizes personalized targeting based on mutations.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'These trials were selected because they specifically address KRAS mutations, including G12C, and some are in accessible locations. Remember, eligibility is determined by the trial team, so factors like your exact stage and treatment history will play a role.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "If you'd like more details on any of these—like specific contact info, trial phases, or how to proceed—let me know. I'm here to guide you through this. Please keep in mind, this information is for educational purposes only, and you should discuss it with your healthcare provider before taking any steps.\n" +
