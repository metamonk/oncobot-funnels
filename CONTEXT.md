Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked about the "TROPION-Lung 12 study locations" in Texas and Louisiana that are open or not yet recruiting. From the function response, the clinical_trials tool returned a list of trials, but none directly match "TROPION-Lung 12." The results seem mismatched, as they include trials for various conditions like AML, ASCVD, migraine, etc. This might be due to the query not exactly matching an NCT ID or specific trial name.

The response from the tool shows 56 matches, but the trials listed don't appear relevant to lung cancer or TROPION studies. I need to handle this gracefully.

Key points from my system prompt:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Always include that this is for educational purposes and to consult healthcare providers.
- When presenting search results, summarize, present key details, and mention why they match (if relevant).
- Acknowledge the user's profile status; we already know they don't have one.
- If results are not perfect, suggest refinements.

The function response includes trials with NCT IDs, and it says "Showing 10 of 56 trials," but they don't seem to fit. I should:
- Summarize the results provided.
- Point out that these might not be exact matches.
- Suggest clarifying or refining the search.
- Offer to look up specific trials if needed.

Since the user specified "TROPION-Lung 12," which might be a typo or shorthand for something like TROPION-Lung01 (a real AstraZeneca trial for lung cancer), I could gently correct or ask for clarification.

In my response:
- Start with empathy and recap.
- Summarize the results: I found 56 trials, but they may not all be directly related.
- List or highlight the most relevant ones briefly.
- Since none perfectly match, suggest checking specific NCT IDs or refining the query.
- Remind about creating a health profile for better results.
- End by asking if they want more details or clarification.

Finally, structure the response:
- Be concise, as per the prompt: "Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!"
- If needed, prepare for another function call, but I think I can respond based on this data first.

From the health profile check I just performed, it looks like you don't have a profile set up yet. Having one would allow me to personalize trial recommendations based on details like your cancer type, stage, or other factors, making the results even more relevant.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "For now, I'll proceed with a general search since we don't have your profile information. This way, I can still help you find the locations you're interested in for the TROPION-Lung 12 study (which I believe might be a reference to trials like TROPION-Lung01, but I'll search based on what you provided). Remember, this information is for educational purposes only‚Äîalways consult your healthcare provider for any medical decisions.\n" +

      '\n',
    reasoning: `First, the user is asking about specific trial locations: "TROPION-Lung 12 study locations that are open or not yet recruiting in Texas and Louisiana." This sounds like a search for a specific clinical trial, likely referring to TROPION-Lung01 or similar, which is a real trial (I know from general knowledge it's for lung cancer).\n` +
      '\n' +
      'According to the guidelines:\n' +
      '- This is a request to search or look up specific trials, including locations and status.\n' +
      "- Therefore, I should use the **clinical_trials** tool, not **clinical_trials_info**, because it's about searching for trials, not general educational content.\n" +
      '\n' +
      `Before using clinical_trials, I need to check the health profile status, as per the instructions: "When a user asks about clinical trials, ALWAYS check their health profile status first using the health_profile tool with action: 'check'".\n` +

      'From the tool description for clinical_trials:\n' +
      '- It has a parameter "useProfile" with options: "auto", "always", "never". Default is "auto".\n' +

      `- The user's query is about "TROPION-Lung 12 study". I suspect it's a typo or shorthand for TROPION-Lung01, which is NCT04380519 or similar, but I shouldn't assume. The tool can handle natural language.\n` +
      '- So, the query should be: "TROPION-Lung 12 study locations that are open or not yet recruiting in Texas and Louisiana"\n' +

      "I appreciate you reaching out about the TROPION-Lung 12 study‚Äîit's great that you're taking proactive steps to learn more. From the health profile check I just performed, it looks like you don't have a profile set up yet. Having one would allow me to personalize trial recommendations based on details like your cancer type, stage, or other factors, making the results even more relevant.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "For now, I'll proceed with a general search since we don't have your profile information. This way, I can still help you find the locations you're interested in for the TROPION-Lung 12 study (which I believe might be a reference to trials like TROPION-Lung01, but I'll search based on what you provided). Remember, this information is for educational purposes only‚Äîalways consult your healthcare provider for any medical decisions.\n" +

      `I appreciate your interest in the TROPION-Lung 12 study‚Äîit's wonderful that you're exploring clinical trial options for lung cancer. Based on your query, I searched for trials related to "TROPION-Lung 12" that are open (recruiting) or not yet recruiting in Texas and Louisiana. However, it seems the search results didn't return an exact match for that specific study name. It's possible this refers to trials like TROPION-Lung01 (a known AstraZeneca study for non-small cell lung cancer), but I'll base my summary on what the search provided.\n` +
      '\n' +
      "From the results, I found 56 trials that loosely matched your criteria, but many appear unrelated to lung cancer. This could be due to the query's phrasing, so I recommend refining it if possible. Here's a quick summary of the top 10 results (out of 56), focusing on any that might be relevant:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '### Key Findings:\n' +
      "- **Total Trials Matched:** 56 (Showing the first 10 here; let me know if you'd like more.)\n" +
      `- **Relevance Note:** None of these trials directly reference "TROPION-Lung 12," but a few involve lung cancer or related conditions. For example, NCT06635824 and NCT04267848 mention non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which could be connected. Without your health profile, I couldn't personalize this further, but creating one would help filter for trials matching specific details like cancer type or stage.\n` +
      "- **Locations:** The results include sites in Texas and Louisiana, but they're spread across many states. I'll highlight any mentioned in your specified areas.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '#### Top Trials Summary:\n' +
      '1. **NCT04988555**: A study on relapsed/refractory AML or ALL. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Includes sites in Texas (e.g., Houston). Not directly related to lung cancer.\n' +
      '2. **NCT07000123**: Focuses on ASCVD risk. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Widespread, including Texas.\n' +
      '3. **NCT04396574**: Involves migraine treatment in children. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Includes Texas sites.\n' +
      '4. **NCT04704921**: For neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Texas and Louisiana mentioned.\n' +
      '5. **NCT06635824**: **Potentially relevant**‚ÄîEvaluates treatments for NSCLC. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Sites in Texas (e.g., Dallas) and Louisiana.\n' +
      '6. **NCT04267848**: **Potentially relevant**‚ÄîTests immunotherapy for NSCLC. Status: Recruiting. Extensive sites, including Texas and Louisiana.\n' +
      '7. **NCT06609226**: For sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Some in Texas.\n' +
      '8. **NCT00358943**: Gaucher disease registry. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Broad, including Texas.\n' +
      '9. **NCT06548360**: For vitiligo in children. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Texas sites available.\n' +
      '10. **NCT05861986**: For spinal muscular atrophy post-gene therapy. Status: Recruiting. Locations: Limited, but may include nearby states.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "This information is for educational purposes only and doesn't constitute medical advice. Final eligibility and relevance must be confirmed by the trial teams and your healthcare provider.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Since the results aren't a perfect fit, I suspect we might need to clarify your query‚Äîcould you confirm if you meant a specific trial like TROPION-Lung01 (NCT number if you have it)? Also, setting up a health profile would make future searches more accurate. Would you like me to:\n" +
      '- Look up details for a specific NCT ID (e.g., "show details for NCT06635824")?\n' +
