      "- **Overall Status**: Recruiting (meaning it's currently open for enrollment in some locations).\n" +
      "- **Relevance to You**: This trial focuses on early-stage adenocarcinoma NSCLC (a type of lung cancer). It includes criteria related to tumor characteristics like ctDNA status or high-risk features, which could make it relevant if your health profile aligns with these (e.g., based on stage or biomarkers). Since I don't have your full health profile on file, I can't confirm a perfect match, but it's worth discussing with your doctor.\n" +

      '- **Texas**: There are sites in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Specifically:\n' +
      '  - 4 sites are currently recruiting.\n' +
      '  - 3 sites are not yet recruiting.\n' +
      "  - This means you have options in these areas if you're able to travel there.\n" +
      '  \n' +

Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked: "Which are the closest locations to Louisiana?" in reference to the TROPION-Lung12 trial. I previously searched for that trial and found no sites in Louisiana, but sites in Texas.

In my last response, I called the clinical_trials function, and now the simulated response is that the search failed with 0 trials found. That's an error response.

The function call I made was: 
<function_call>{
    "action": "clinical_trials",
    "action_input": {
        "query": "Closest locations to Louisiana for TROPION-Lung12 trial",
        "maxResults": 10
    }
}</function_call>

The response from the function is: {"success":false,"error":"Search failed","matches":[],"totalCount":0,"message":"Found 0 trials","_fullDataInAnnotations":false}

This means the search didn't return any results. Possible reasons could be that the query didn't match any trials, or there's an issue with the search.

As OncoBot, I need to handle this gracefully:
- Be compassionate and supportive.
- Don't leave the user empty-handed.
- Suggest next steps, like refining the query or providing alternatives.
- Remind them that this is for educational purposes.

Key guidelines:
- If a search fails, I should acknowledge it and offer help.
- I can suggest using the user's location (which is near Chicago) or ask for more details.
- The system mentions that the tool has automatic fallbacks, so I could suggest broadening the search.

Possible actions:
- Since the search failed, I shouldn't just end the conversation. I need to respond helpfully.
- I could ask for clarification or suggest related searches.
- If appropriate, I could use another tool, but nothing directly fits here.
- The user might mean closest to their location in Louisiana, but I know the user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298 (Chicago area), not Louisiana. I should clarify that.

In the initial system prompt, the user's location is given as 41.8781, -87.6298, which is Chicago. But the query is about locations closest to Louisiana. I need to handle this carefully.

In my previous response, I noted: "I see your location is near Chicago, based on our records—there might be options there too."

Best response:
- Acknowledge the failed search.
- Explain that no results were found for that specific query.
- Offer to search for trials near the user's actual location (Chicago) or in nearby states to Louisiana.
- Ask if they meant closest to their location or specify.
- Keep it conversational and supportive.

Finally, structure the response:
- Start with empathy.
- Summarize what happened.
- Suggest next steps.
- End with a question to continue the conversation.

      '- Search for other lung cancer trials that might be available near Louisiana or in surrounding states.\n' +
      '- Check for updates on the TROPION-Lung12 trial specifically.\n' +
      '- Use your Chicago location to find relevant trials there, if that applies.\n' +

    content: "I understand you're looking for details on the TROPION-Lung12 study, specifically the locations in Texas and Louisiana that are either open (likely recruiting) or not yet recruiting. This is a great step in exploring your options—I'll help search for that information right away.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Based on your query, I'll pull up the relevant trial details. Let me check for this.\n" +

      "I appreciate you providing more details about the TROPION-Lung12 study—it's great that you're taking proactive steps to explore your options. Based on my search, I was able to locate information on what appears to be the trial you're referring to (NCT06564844, a Phase 3 study involving adjuvant therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer). Let me break this down for you clearly.\n" +

      '### What I Found:\n' +
      "I searched for locations in Texas and Louisiana that are either recruiting or not yet recruiting. Here's a summary of the relevant details from the results:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '- **Trial Name and ID**: NCT06564844 – "A Phase III, Randomised Study of Adjuvant Dato-DXd in Combination With Rilvegostomig or Rilvegostomig Monotherapy Versus Standard of Care, Following Complete Tumour Resection, in Participants With Stage I Adenocarcinoma NSCLC Who Are ctDNA-positive or Have High-risk Pathological Features."\n' +
      "- **Overall Status**: Recruiting (meaning it's currently open for enrollment in some locations).\n" +
      "- **Relevance to You**: This trial focuses on early-stage adenocarcinoma NSCLC (a type of lung cancer). It includes criteria related to tumor characteristics like ctDNA status or high-risk features, which could make it relevant if your health profile aligns with these (e.g., based on stage or biomarkers). Since I don't have your full health profile on file, I can't confirm a perfect match, but it's worth discussing with your doctor.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '#### Locations in Texas and Louisiana:\n' +
      '- **Texas**: There are sites in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Specifically:\n' +
      '  - 4 sites are currently recruiting.\n' +
      '  - 3 sites are not yet recruiting.\n' +
      "  - This means you have options in these areas if you're able to travel there.\n" +
      '  \n' +
      "- **Louisiana**: Unfortunately, the search results did not list any active sites in Louisiana for this trial. The overall location summary mentions 85 sites across 28 states in the US, but Louisiana wasn't highlighted in the details returned. It's possible there are no sites there, or they might not be recruiting/not yet recruiting at this time. If this is important to you, I can help refine the search or suggest checking for updates.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'This trial is part of ongoing research in lung cancer treatment, and the locations provided are based on the latest available data as of today, September 7, 2025.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Next Steps:\n' +
      "If you'd like, we can:\n" +
      '- Look into more details about the Texas sites (e.g., contact information or specific eligibility requirements).\n' +
      '- Search for other similar trials in Louisiana or closer to your area (I see your location is near Chicago, based on our records—there might be options there too).\n' +
      '- Check if you have a health profile set up, which could help personalize future searches even more.\n' +
