Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user queried: "kras g12c trials chicago". This is clearly a request to search for specific trials, so I should use the clinical_trials tool, which I already did in my previous response.

The function call response shows that the search was successful but returned 0 matches. Specifically:

- "success": true

- "matches": []

- "totalCount": 0

This means no trials were found that match the criteria. The metadata indicates there was an error in the original execution ("this.generateMatchReason is not a function"), but it fell back to a broad search.

I need to handle this gracefully. As per my instructions:

- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.

- Don't leave users empty-handed; provide helpful resources or suggestions.

- Acknowledge what information was used from their profile.

From the response, the user's profile includes:

- Cancer type: NSCLC

- Disease stage: STAGE_IV

- Molecular markers: KRAS_G12C positive

- Location: Chicago area

Since no trials were found, I should:

1. Inform the user that no matching trials were found.

2. Suggest next steps, like refining the search, checking for updates, or consulting their doctor.

3. Offer to search more broadly or for related topics.

4. Remind them that this is for educational purposes and not medical advice.

Key points from instructions:

- When presenting search results, start with a summary.

- Always mention why trials match (or in this case, why none did).

- If search returns 0 results, acknowledge it's too broad or no matches, and suggest refinements.

- Use the health profile context: "Based on your NSCLC diagnosis with KRAS G12C mutation and your location in Chicago..."

Since the search used the profile, I can reference that.

Finally, structure my response:

- Start with empathy and summary.

- Explain the result.

- Provide suggestions.

- End with a disclaimer.

      '\n' +
      'I need to determine which tool to use. According to the instructions:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- Use the "clinical_trials" tool for searching or looking up specific trials, such as requests to find trials for a particular condition or location.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- This includes phrases like "Find trials for KRAS G12C" or "Show me trials near Chicago".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This query is clearly about searching for specific trials (KRAS G12C) and specifying a location (Chicago). So, I should use the "clinical_trials" tool.\n' +
      '\n' +
      `Before proceeding, I need to check the health profile status. The instructions say: "When a user asks about clinical trials, ALWAYS check their health profile status first using the health_profile tool with action: 'check'".\n` +
      '\n' +
      `The system prompt emphasizes: "CRITICAL: When a user asks about clinical trials, ALWAYS check their health profile status first using the health_profile tool with action: 'check'".\n` +
      '\n' +
      'So, even though this is a search query, I must first check the health profile.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "The user's location is given as 41.8781, -87.6298, which is Chicago, so that matches the query.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'Steps I should take:\n' +
      '\n' +
      "1. Call the health_profile tool with action: 'check' to see if the user has a profile.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '2. If the profile exists and is complete, then proceed to call the clinical_trials tool with the query.\n' +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      'In the tool description for clinical_trials, it says it automatically uses the health profile when available, so after checking, I can proceed.\n' +

      `The prompt says: "Call a function decisively if the logical next step to advance the user's request can be achieved by calling a provided function."\n` +
      '\n' +
      'The logical first step is to check the health profile.\n' +
      '\n' +

      'In multi-turn conversations, I might need to chain function calls.\n' +

      'For this response, I should start with the health_profile check.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Finally, when I call clinical_trials, I need to include the user's location if relevant. The tool parameters include userLatitude and userLongitude, which are optional but I have them: 41.8781, -87.6298.\n" +

      '- Then, based on that, in a subsequent response, call clinical_trials.\n' +

      '\n' +
      `Response structure: If I'm calling a function, my response should just be the function call, or perhaps a brief message followed by it, but the prompt says: "Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!"\n` +
      '\n' +
      "So, for now, I'll output the function call for health_profile.\n" +

Consider updating your health profile with this information for more targeted results.\\"\\n  - **CRITICAL**: When presenting trials, if any specifically target the user's mutations (like KRAS G12C), highlight this prominently\\n  - Use different health_profile actions to get specific details when needed\\n\\n  ### Conversational Flow:\\n  - Remember previous search results in the conversation\\n  - The clinical_trials tool automatically uses the health profile when useProfile: true\\n  - No need to call health_profile separately unless user specifically asks about their profile\\n  - Support natural follow-up questions like:\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Tell me more about the second trial\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Where is that one located?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"How can I contact them?\\"\\n    ‚Ä¢ \\"Are there any closer to Boston?\\"\\n  - Offer helpful suggestions based on what you've found\\n\\n  ### Using Your Tools:\\n  **health_profile tool:**\\n  - check: Quick check if user has a profile (only use when user asks about their profile)\\n  - get_summary: Get a brief overview of their health profile\\n  - get_details: Get comprehensive profile information including all responses\\n  - completion_status: Check which sections of the profile are complete\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials_info tool (for educational content):**\\n  - Use for ALL informational/educational questions\\n  - Provides curated, authoritative information\\n  - NOT for searching - only for explaining how trials work\\n  - Pass: { query: \\"user's question\\", hasHealthProfile: true/false }\\n  \\n  **clinical_trials tool (for searching AND looking up specific trials):**\\n  - Use for ANY query about specific trials or NCT IDs\\n  - Examples:\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID lookup: { query: \\"What are the locations for NCT05568550?\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ NCT ID details: { query: \\"Show me details for NCT12345678\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ New search: { query: \\"find trials for my cancer\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ Location filter: { query: \\"show them near Chicago\\" }\\n    ‚Ä¢ More results: { query: \\"show me more\\" }\\n  - The tool automatically:\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects NCT IDs and retrieves full trial details\\n    ‚Ä¢ Detects if it's a new search or follow-up\\n    ‚Ä¢ Extracts locations from natural language\\n    ‚Ä¢ Uses the health profile when relevant\\n    ‚Ä¢ Maintains conversation context\\n\\n  **Location tool (find_place_on_map):**\\n  - Use this ONLY when users specifically ask \\"where is it?\\" or \\"show me on a map\\"\\n  - Can help locate specific trial sites or cancer centers when requested\\n  - Do NOT use proactively - wait for explicit location requests\\n\\n  **web_search**: For general health information or recent medical news\\n  **retrieve**: When users share specific URLs to analyze\\n\\n  ### When Presenting SEARCH Results (clinical_trials tool ONLY):\\n  - Start with a summary: \\"I found X trials that might be relevant...\\"\\n  - Present key details clearly: name, phase, status, brief description\\n  - **ALWAYS mention why each trial matches the user's profile**: cancer type, stage, molecular markers\\n  \\n  ### When Providing INFORMATION (clinical_trials_info tool):\\n  - DO NOT mention finding or searching for trials\\n  - Focus on educational content only\\n  - Provide clear, authoritative information about the topic\\n  - DO NOT say \\"I found X trials\\" - you're explaining concepts, not searching\\n  - Highlight trials that specifically target the user's mutations (e.g., KRAS G12C)\\n  - Group trials by relevance: exact matches first, then broader matches\\n  - Mention eligibility indicators when available\\n  - Always note locations and whether they're recruiting\\n  - For follow-ups, reference the specific trial they're asking about\\n  - If search returns >1000 results, acknowledge it's too broad and suggest refinements\\n\\n  ### Example Conversational Patterns:\\n  \\n  **For SEARCH queries (clinical_trials tool):**\\n  - \\"I found 15 trials for lung cancer. The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  \\n  **For INFORMATIONAL queries (clinical_trials_info tool):**\\n  - \\"Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments in people...\\"\\n  - \\"To qualify for a trial, you typically need to meet specific eligibility criteria...\\"\\n  - \\"The phases of clinical trials serve different purposes...\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes. Please consult your healthcare provider before making any medical decisions.\\"\\n  - Be transparent about limitations\\n  - Don't recommend specific trials over others\\n  - Remind users that final eligibility is determined by trial teams\\n\\n\\nThe user's location is 41.8781, -87.6298."},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"user","content":"kras g12c trials chicago"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Before I help you search for clinical trials related to KRAS G12C mutation near Chicago, I need to quickly check if you have a health profile.
