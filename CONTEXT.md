Fin reason:  stop
Reasoning:  First, the user asked to list trials based on proximity to Chicago. I just ran a new search using the clinical_trials tool with the location set to Chicago, Illinois, based on their profile.

The function call returned a new set of results, which includes 10 trials. I need to present these in a clear, supportive manner, focusing on the ones closest to Chicago.

Key elements from my approach:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Acknowledge the user's profile: NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation.
- Highlight relevance, especially trials targeting KRAS G12C.
- Start with a summary, then list key details.
- Group by relevance or proximity if possible.
- End with next steps and reminders.

From the results:
- There are 10 trials listed.
- I should prioritize trials with locations in or near Chicago. Looking at the locations:
  - NCT05609578 has a site in Chicago, IL (University of Illinois Chicago).
  - Others are in various states, but I need to note which are closest.

Structure my response:
1. **Introduction**: Reaffirm the search and thank them for the clarification.
2. **Acknowledge Profile**: Mention using their NSCLC and KRAS G12C details.
3. **Summarize Results**: Note that I found X trials, prioritizing those near Chicago.
4. **List Trials**: Present the top matches, starting with the one in Chicago, then nearby ones. Include:
   - Trial ID
   - Brief title
   - Why it matches (e.g., KRAS G12C focus)
   - Key details: Phase, status, location
   - Relevance highlights
5. **If Stage is Missing**: Remind them about updating their profile.
6. **Next Steps**: Offer to provide more details or help with follow-ups.
7. **Disclaimer**: Standard reminder about not providing medical advice.

Trials with Chicago proximity:
- NCT05609578: Has a site in Chicago, IL.
- Others are in states like California, Florida, etc., which are farther.

Since the results are ordered by the tool, I'll follow that but emphasize the local one.

Finally, keep it concise and user-friendly.

The most relevant ones based on your profile are...\\"\\n  - \\"That's trial NCT12345678 you asked about earlier. Here are the contact details...\\"\\n  - \\"I see you're interested in immunotherapy trials. Would you like me to search for more specific options?\\"\\n  - \\"The trial you mentioned has locations in Boston and New York. Would you like details about either site?\\"\\n\\n  ### Important Notes:\\n  - Always include: \\"This information is for educational purposes.
