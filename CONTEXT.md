# Context - Current Status

## Application Status
- Development server running successfully
- Vercel Analytics integrated comprehensively
- Contact form working with dual integration (Resend + GoHighLevel)
- Analytics dashboard tracking implemented

## Build Issues - In Progress
### Issue: useSearchParams() Suspense Boundary Error
Next.js 15 requires client components that use browser-specific features during static generation to either:
1. Use `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to disable static generation
2. Wrap components using `useSearchParams()` in Suspense boundaries

### Affected Pages (Fixed with dynamic exports):
- ✅ `/contact` - Added dynamic export
- ✅ `/membership/booking` - Added dynamic export
- ✅ `/membership/thank-you` - Added dynamic export
- ✅ `/membership` - Added dynamic export
- ✅ `/eligibility/[indication]` - Added dynamic export
- ✅ `/eligibility/[indication]/quiz` - Added dynamic export
- ✅ `/eligibility/[indication]/monitoring-confirmation` - Added dynamic export

### Root Cause:
The `useFunnelAnalytics` hook calls `getUTMParams()` which accesses `window.location.search` during initialization. This causes issues during static generation as `window` is not available.

### Solution Applied:
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all client pages that use `useFunnelAnalytics` or `useSearchParams` to force dynamic rendering and skip static generation.

### Next Steps:
The build is still failing due to cache issues with Turbopack. Recommend:
1. Build without Turbopack flag temporarily: `pnpm next build`
2. Or clear all caches and rebuild: `rm -rf .next .turbo node_modules/.cache && pnpm build`

## Recent Completions
- Implemented comprehensive Vercel Analytics integration
- Created VercelAnalyticsProvider class
- Integrated with unified analytics system
- Added event tracking to analytics dashboard
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
- Applied dynamic rendering to all affected pages
- All linting passes with only minor warnings

## Development Notes
- Using Next.js 15.4.2 with Turbopack
- All routes compiling and serving successfully in dev mode
- Google Analytics ID not configured (expected in development)
- Some build issues with Turbopack caching - may need to build without Turbopack flag
