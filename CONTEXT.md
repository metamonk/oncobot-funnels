Reasoning:  First, the user queried "kras g12c chicago," which I interpreted as a request for clinical trials related to KRAS G12C mutations in the Chicago area. I checked their health profile, confirmed it's complete, and then called the clinical_trials tool.

The function call to clinical_trials returned results for 5 trials out of 16 total matches. These trials are relevant to KRAS G12C and NSCLC, based on the user's profile.

In my response, I need to:
- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.
- Summarize the results clearly.
- Highlight why each trial matches the user's profile, especially the KRAS G12C mutation.
- Include key details like NCT ID, title, phase, status, and locations.
- Remind the user that this is for educational purposes and they should consult their healthcare provider.
- Offer next steps, like asking if they want more details or more results.

Structure the response:
1. Start with a positive, encouraging summary.
2. Present the trials in a clear, concise manner.
3. Acknowledge the user's profile details used.
4. End with a disclaimer and an offer for more help.

Key points from the results:
- All trials are for NSCLC and target KRAS G12C.
- Locations include Chicago, which matches the user's query.
- User's profile: NSCLC, Stage IV, KRAS G12C positive, etc.
- There are 16 total trials, and I've shown 5.

Since the response has "hasMore": true, I can mention that there are more results available.

Finally, keep it concise and not verbose.

      '\n' +
      'Before I dive into searching for specific trials, I want to make sure I can provide the most personalized results for you. Let me quickly check if you have a health profile set up, as it helps me tailor recommendations based on details like your cancer type, stage, or other factors.\n' +
      '\n',
    reasoning: `First, the user said: "kras g12c chicago". This looks like a query about clinical trials related to KRAS G12C mutation, and they're specifying a location, Chicago. My user location is already given as 41.8781, -87.6298, which is Chicago.\n` +
      '\n' +
      'I need to determine if this is an informational question or a search for specific trials. According to the guidelines:\n' +
      '\n' +
      `- If it's about searching or looking up specific trials, like "Find trials for KRAS G12C near Chicago", I should use the "clinical_trials" tool.\n` +
      '\n' +
      `- If it's informational, like "What is KRAS G12C?", I should use "clinical_trials_info".\n` +
      '\n' +
      `This seems to be a request to find trials: "kras g12c chicago" likely means "find trials for KRAS G12C in Chicago". It's not asking about what KRAS G12C is; it's implying a search.\n` +
      '\n' +
      'So, this falls under using the "clinical_trials" tool for searching specific trials.\n' +
      '\n' +
      `Before using the clinical_trials tool, I need to check the user's health profile status. The guidelines say: "When a user asks about clinical trials, ALWAYS check their health profile status first using the health_profile tool with action: 'check'".\n` +

      `In the instructions: "CRITICAL: When a user asks about clinical trials, ALWAYS check their health profile status first using the health_profile tool with action: 'check'"\n` +
      '\n' +
      'So, my first step is to call: <function_call> for health_profile with query: "check"\n' +
      '\n' +
      'After that, based on the response, I can proceed to the clinical_trials search.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The user might not have a profile, so I need to handle that.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Once I have the profile status, I can then call clinical_trials with the query.\n' +
      '\n' +
      `For the clinical_trials call, the query should be something like "trials for KRAS G12C in Chicago". I can use the user's latitude and longitude if needed, but the tool has optional parameters for that.\n` +
      '\n' +
      `Looking at the tool: it has "user_latitude" and "user_longitude" as properties, but they're not required. Since the user's location is known, I could include it for better results.\n` +

      `In the available functions, for clinical_trials, it's: properties include "user_latitude" and "user_longitude", so I can pass them.\n` +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Plan:\n' +

    text: "I appreciate you sharing more about your interest in KRAS G12C trials‚Äîit's a targeted area for cancers like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and I'm glad we could use your health profile to refine the search. Based on your profile, which indicates NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation and Stage IV disease, I found 16 relevant trials. I've pulled the top 5 matches that align with your query for trials in the Chicago area. These focus on KRAS G12C inhibitors and are actively recruiting, with several sites conveniently located near you in Illinois.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Here's a quick summary of the trials:\n" +
      '\n' +
      '1. **NCT06890598**: A Phase 3 study testing Olomorasib combined with standard treatments for KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. It matches your profile due to the KRAS G12C focus and NSCLC diagnosis. Locations include the University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Chicago Medical Center (both recruiting). Relevance: High, as it targets your mutation and stage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. **NCT06497556**: This Phase 3 trial compares Divarasib to other KRAS G12C inhibitors for advanced NSCLC. It aligns with your KRAS G12C mutation and metastatic status. Sites: Rush University Medical Center and University of Chicago Medical Center in Chicago (recruiting). Relevance: Strong match for your mutation and cancer type.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "3. **NCT06026410**: A Phase 1 study evaluating KO-2806, either alone or in combination, for KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors including NSCLC. It fits your profile's KRAS G12C positivity and advanced disease. Locations: No direct Chicago sites in this set, but nearby options like in Los Angeles (recruiting). Relevance: Good for your mutation, though it's an earlier-phase trial.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '4. **NCT03785249**: Phase 1/2 study of MRTX849 (Adagrasib) for KRAS G12C-mutant cancers. This one matches your KRAS G12C mutation and NSCLC. Sites: One in Chicago (status: withdrawn), with other nearby recruiting locations. Relevance: Directly targets your mutation, but check for active sites.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "5. **NCT06119581**: A Phase 3 trial combining Olomorasib with immunotherapy for KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. It aligns with your profile's mutation, stage, and cancer type. Locations: University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Chicago Hospital (both recruiting). Relevance: Excellent match for your specific KRAS G12C mutation and advanced NSCLC.\n" +

      'In my response, I need to:\n' +
      '- Be warm, supportive, and conversational.\n' +
      '- Summarize the results clearly.\n' +
      "- Highlight why each trial matches the user's profile, especially the KRAS G12C mutation.\n" +
      '- Include key details like NCT ID, title, phase, status, and locations.\n' +
      '- Remind the user that this is for educational purposes and they should consult their healthcare provider.\n' +
      '- Offer next steps, like asking if they want more details or more results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Structure the response:\n' +
      '1. Start with a positive, encouraging summary.\n' +
      '2. Present the trials in a clear, concise manner.\n' +
      "3. Acknowledge the user's profile details used.\n" +
      '4. End with a disclaimer and an offer for more help.\n' +
