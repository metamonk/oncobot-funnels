1. we should have /ai-terms be /terms instead - in some of the places we have it (header), it actually points to onco.bot/terms - the same one for the AI assistant component. the existing page might be a remnant of the app that this funnel system was refactored from. should this funnel system have it's own terms? If so we should make it.

2. /new is not needed - it is a remnant of the pre-existing app that this funnel system was refactored from. 

3. /how-it-works is unnecessary - please remove this and any associated code.

4. /pricing is unnecessary - please remove this and any associated code. this is a funnel system, not a product.

5. /blog - I don't think this is necessary. I plan on creating a blog but it will be hosted separately at blog.onco.bot - will it impact the overall SEO poorly?

6. /careers is unnecessary - please remove this and any associated code.

7. /hipaa - would this replace our /privacy page? I believe the /privacy page is a remnant of the old app from which this funnel system was refactored from. what do you think we should do?

8. /disclaimer is unnecessary I think. do you think we should keep it? respond in a way that is contextual to this funnel system.

9. what is /analytics used for?

let's make extra sure that everything that is built is in accordance and in alignment to our design system and language.
