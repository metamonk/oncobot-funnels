‚è∫ ‚úÖ Context-Aware Search Pipeline Implementation Complete

  I've successfully implemented a comprehensive context-aware search
  pipeline that preserves ALL information throughout the entire query
  processing flow. Here's what was accomplished:

  üéØ Key Achievements

  1. Created QueryContext System (query-context.ts)
    - Comprehensive interface that captures everything: original query,
  extracted entities, inferred intent, user context, execution plan
    - Builder pattern for easy construction
    - Tracking system for decisions and learning
    - No information loss between pipeline layers
  2. Enhanced Query Classifier
    - New buildQueryContext() method that extracts ALL entities dynamically
    - Handles ANY cancer type, mutation, drug, location - not hard-coded
    - Infers user intent, urgency, knowledge level
    - Creates enriched queries using health profile data
  3. Updated Search Strategy Executor
    - New executeWithContext() method preserves full context
    - Fallback strategies when primary doesn't yield enough results
    - Context-aware compression for location relevance
    - Comprehensive match scoring based on all extracted entities
  4. Enhanced Router
    - routeWithContext() method ensures no information loss
    - Tracks all decisions made throughout the pipeline
    - Attaches full context to results for learning
  5. Validated with Test Script
    - Successfully extracts entities from diverse queries
    - Preserves context throughout pipeline
    - No information loss verified
    - Handles queries with and without health profiles

  üìä Test Results Show:

  - ‚úÖ Location extraction works: "Chicago", "near me", "within 50 miles"
  - ‚úÖ Mutation extraction works: "KRAS G12C", "EGFR exon 19", "ALK fusion"
  - ‚úÖ NCT extraction works: Single and multiple NCT IDs
  - ‚úÖ Drug extraction works: Specific drug names recognized
  - ‚úÖ Context preservation: Original query never lost
  - ‚úÖ Enrichment working: Health profile data properly added

  üöÄ Benefits of This Architecture:

  1. No Information Loss: Every piece of the user's query is preserved
  2. Learning Ready: Full tracking for automated improvement
  3. Flexible & Dynamic: Works with ANY cancer type, mutation, or drug
  4. Fallback Strategies: Multiple search approaches for better results
  5. Context-Aware Compression: Location relevance properly handled

  üîÑ Future Improvements Enabled:

  The QueryContext system now enables:
  - Automated learning from user interactions
  - A/B testing of different strategies
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Gradual AI integration for complex queries
  - User preference learning

  This implementation addresses the root architectural problem -
  information was being lost between layers. Now the entire context flows
  through the pipeline, ensuring accurate, comprehensive, and context-aware
   results for ANY cancer-related query.

‚è∫ Looking at those NCT IDs you've selected, let me outline what's next for
  the context-aware search pipeline:

  üéØ Next Steps

  1. Integration with Main Tool (Priority 1)

  We need to update the main clinical trials tool entry point to use the
  new context-aware pipeline:
  - /lib/tools/clinical-trials.ts - Update to use routeWithContext()
  instead of old route()
  - Ensure the tool properly passes user coordinates and health profile

  2. Test with Real NCT IDs (Priority 2)

  Those NCT IDs you selected should be tested to ensure:
  - Batch NCT lookup works correctly
  - Location context is preserved when asking "Are these trials in
  Chicago?"
  - The compression properly prioritizes Chicago-area locations

  3. Implement Learning/Feedback Loop (Priority 3)

  Now that we have QueryContext tracking everything:
  - Add interaction tracking to know which trials users click
  - Store successful query patterns
  - Build the automated learning system we discussed

  4. Performance Optimization (Priority 4)

  - Add caching layer that uses QueryContext as cache key
  - Implement parallel search strategies for better performance
  - Optimize token usage with context-aware compression

  5. Production Deployment Prep (Priority 5)

  - Add comprehensive error handling
  - Implement rate limiting
  - Add monitoring/logging for the context pipeline
  - Create migration plan from old to new system

  Which would you like to tackle first?

  Given the NCT IDs you're looking at, I suggest we start with Integration 
  with Main Tool so you can immediately start using the context-aware
  pipeline for real searches. This would let you test queries like:
  - "Are NCT03785249 and NCT05638295 in Chicago?"
  - "Show me these trials: NCT06497556, NCT05609578, NCT04613596"

  This will give immediate value while we build out the learning systems.
