# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ReferenceError: Cannot access 'status' before initialization
**File**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials.ts`
**Line**: 662
**Fix**: Moved the `status` variable declaration to line 528, before it's used in the molecular marker scoring section.

### 2. Zod Validation Error in Eligibility Analyzer
**File**: `/lib/tools/eligibility-analyzer.ts`
**Issue**: Arrays were returning more than 3 items but schema limited to 3
**Fix**: Increased array limits from 3 to 5 for:
- `inclusionMatches`
- `exclusionConcerns`
- `uncertainFactors`

### 3. ReferenceError: 'data' is not defined
**File**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials.ts`
**Lines**: 1253, 1255, 1287
**Fix**: Changed `data.totalCount` to `totalCount` (the variable that was actually defined in scope)

### 4. Added queryMetadata to response
**File**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials.ts`
**Line**: 1296-1299
**Fix**: Added queryMetadata object to the return statement to provide information about which queries were executed

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the fixes:
- `test-api-directly.ts` - Tests the ClinicalTrials.gov API directly
- API test confirms all 3 queries work correctly:
  - Query 1 (broad): 2328 results
  - Query 2 (KRAS G12C specific): 60 results
  - Query 3 (drug-based): 32 results

## Next Steps

The user should:
1. Refresh the browser page at https://onco.bot/search/f6b383f1-cc06-48f2-a23c-138e4092d9d9
2. Try the search again
3. The system should now properly execute all 3 queries and return KRAS G12C trials

The fixes ensure:
- No more runtime errors
- Proper multi-query execution
- Better error handling in eligibility analysis
- Correct variable scoping throughout the code
