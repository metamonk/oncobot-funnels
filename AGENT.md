 Agent's API Call Flexibility

  Looking at the tool structure, the agent has several options:

  Current Capabilities:

  1. Single Search Execution: The tool executes one search per call based on parameters
  2. Multiple Actions Available:
    - search: Initial broad search
    - details: Get specific trial details
    - eligibility_check: Deep eligibility analysis
    - refine: (Not implemented but scaffolded)

  What the Agent CAN Do:

  - Make multiple sequential calls to the tool
  - Adjust search parameters between calls
  - Use different actions to drill down into specific trials
  - Combine results from multiple searches

  What the Agent CANNOT Do Currently:

  - Make dynamic decisions WITHIN a single tool execution
  - Automatically retry with different parameters if results are too broad/narrow
  - Aggregate results from multiple search strategies in one call

  Current Flow Analysis

  The agent typically follows this pattern:
  1. Initial broad search with user's profile
  2. Present results to user with match scores
  3. If user asks about specific trial → details action
  4. If user wants eligibility check → eligibility_check action

  Potential Improvements to Consider

  1. Simplify query.cond Further

  - Remove ALL molecular markers from initial query
  - Keep it to just condition + cancer type
  - Let ALL detailed matching happen in post-processing

  2. Multi-Strategy Search Approach

  The agent could orchestrate multiple searches:
  - Search 1: Broad condition-based
  - Search 2: Location-specific (if provided)
  - Search 3: Treatment-specific (if relevant)
  - Then merge and de-duplicate results

  3. Progressive Refinement

  - Start with broadest possible search
  - If too many results (>100), add filters progressively
  - If too few results (<5), remove filters progressively

  4. Smarter Scoring Weights

  Currently molecular markers get only 15 points vs 100 for RECRUITING status. Perhaps:
  - Exact molecular marker match: 50+ points
  - Basket trial including the mutation: 30 points
  - Similar pathway targeting: 20 points

  The current approach is actually quite good - it avoids the trap of over-specificity while still
  surfacing relevant results. The main inconsistency is treating some biomarkers specially in the
  query construction when they could all be handled uniformly in the scoring phase.
