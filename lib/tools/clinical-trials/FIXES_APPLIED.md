# Fixes Applied to Clinical Trials Tool

## Immediate Errors Fixed

### 1. ✅ ReferenceError: useProfile is not defined (Line 829)
**Problem**: Variable `useProfile` was referenced but only defined in the error catch block
**Solution**: Replaced with hardcoded `true` value since health profile should always be used when available
```typescript
// Before (ERROR)
const useHealthProfile = useProfile; // useProfile not defined!

// After (FIXED)
const useHealthProfile = true; // Always use health profile if available
```

### 2. ✅ Resumable Stream Connection Timeout
**Problem**: Redis connection timeouts causing stream creation failures
**Solution**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff
```typescript
// Added:
- 2 retry attempts for timeout errors
- Exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms)
- Graceful fallback to regular streaming
```

### 3. ✅ NCT ID Query Handling (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: NCT ID queries were incorrectly using cached results
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive query routing system that prioritizes NCT lookups

## Architecture Improvements Implemented

### Query Router System
- **Created**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials/query-router.ts`
- **Purpose**: Intelligent routing of different query types
- **Benefits**: Extensible, modular, clear separation of concerns

### Pipeline Integration
- **Created**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials/pipeline-integration.ts`
- **Purpose**: Bridges query routing with execution pipelines
- **Benefits**: Unified interface for all query types

### Test Suite
- **Created**: `/lib/tools/clinical-trials/test-query-routing.ts`
- **Purpose**: Validates routing logic and demonstrates extensibility

## Current Status

✅ **All critical errors fixed**
✅ **Type checking passes**
✅ **Query routing architecture in place**
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained**

## Next Steps for Refactoring

While the immediate errors are fixed, the codebase would greatly benefit from the proposed refactor:

### Why Refactor is Still Needed
1. **1,267-line monolithic file** makes maintenance difficult
2. **3 duplicate query interpretation systems** create confusion
3. **Mixed responsibilities** violate single responsibility principle
4. **Poor testability** due to tight coupling

### Recommended Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Extract services (1 week)
   - CacheManager
   - SearchService
   - EligibilityService
   - FormatterService

2. **Phase 2**: Unify query processing (1 week)
   - Remove duplicate interpretation logic
   - Consolidate into single flow

3. **Phase 3**: Implement orchestrator (1 week)
   - Clean coordination layer
   - Clear error boundaries

4. **Phase 4**: Clean interface (3 days)
   - Reduce to ~50 lines
   - Clear API contract

5. **Phase 5**: Testing & migration (1 week)
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Gradual rollout with feature flags

## Immediate Actions You Can Take

### Option 1: Use Current Fixed Version
The tool is now functional with all critical errors fixed. You can:
- Deploy the current version
- Monitor for any remaining issues
- Plan refactor for next sprint

### Option 2: Begin Incremental Refactor
Start with Phase 1 (service extraction) which is low-risk:
```bash
# Start by extracting CacheManager
mkdir -p lib/tools/clinical-trials/services
# Move cache logic to services/cache-manager.ts
```

### Option 3: Full Refactor Sprint
Dedicate a 5-week sprint to complete refactor:
- Week 1-2: Service extraction
- Week 3: Orchestrator implementation
- Week 4: Testing & migration prep
- Week 5: Gradual rollout

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes work:

```bash
# 1. Test NCT ID lookup (should bypass cache)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Tell me about NCT06875310"}]}'

# 2. Test batch NCT lookup
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Are any of these trials in Chicago? NCT05358249, NCT05853575"}]}'

# 3. Monitor logs for resumable stream retry behavior
tail -f logs/app.log | grep "resumable stream"
```

## Conclusion

The immediate production issues are resolved. The system is now functional but would benefit significantly from the proposed architectural refactor for long-term maintainability and extensibility.
