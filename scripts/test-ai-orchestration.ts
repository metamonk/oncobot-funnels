## System Design:

1. Initial search returns minimal data:
   - nctId, briefTitle, locationSummary
   - totalLocations count
   - hasLocationData flag

2. AI sees a trial has locations but no details

3. AI can orchestrate "trial-locations" tool to get details when needed

4. This is TRUE AI-DRIVEN:
   - No pre-loading all location data
   - No filtering or transformations
   - AI decides when it needs more data
   - AI orchestrates tools to get what it needs

Example Flow:
- User: "Find TROPION-Lung12 in Texas"
- AI: Searches, gets trial with locationSummary and totalLocations
- User: "What locations are in Texas?"
- AI: Orchestrates trial-locations tool to get raw location data
- AI: Analyzes raw data and answers about Texas locations

Benefits:
âœ… Minimal initial token usage
âœ… AI has full control over data retrieval
âœ… No hardcoded patterns or filters
âœ… Truly composable atomic tools
âœ… Follows CLAUDE.md principles perfectly
