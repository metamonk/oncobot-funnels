üß† INTELLIGENT QUERY CONTEXT SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION

This system intelligently determines whether to use a user's health profile
based on the context and intent of their query.

User Profile Example:
- Cancer Type: NSCLC
- Stage: Stage IV
- Molecular Markers: KRAS G12C positive

KEY BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH:

1. üéØ PRECISION: Only uses profile when relevant
   - Avoids contaminating research queries with personal data
   - Prevents wrong results for queries about others

2. ü§ñ INTELLIGENCE: AI understands context and intent
   - Detects personal pronouns (my, I, me)
   - Identifies research language (what is, explain, how does)
   - Recognizes queries about others (my mother, friend, patient)

3. üîÑ FLEXIBILITY: Graduated influence levels
   - PRIMARY (1.0): Direct personal queries
   - ENHANCED (0.7): General queries that benefit from context
   - CONTEXTUAL (0.5): Location queries with some relevance
   - BACKGROUND (0.3): Minimal relevance
   - DISABLED (0.0): No relevance

4. ‚ú® USER EXPERIENCE: Better, more relevant results
   - Personal queries get personalized results
   - Research queries get broad, unbiased information
   - Queries about others get appropriate results

${'='.repeat(80)}

The system is now configured to intelligently apply health profile data
based on query context, improving accuracy and relevance of results.
